**Day 1337++** Go for tryhackme's offensive path. Skip the buffer overflow for now, but do everything else. If this is too challenging go to complete beginner path then return. If you aren't ready go to the cyber mentor and do the Practical Ethical Hacking Complete course. 

**Day 8080** You need to learn some webhacking. Go for portswigger academy, unless you have the resources to take GWAPT or eWAPT. You should know and be comfortable with burp intruder, proxy, intercepting, repeater. These are your go to!

**Day 65535** Do the shortest possible lab time for PWK (30 days). Ignore the pdf and videos. Ignore the buffer overflow. Go straight to the boxes. You should get about 1-2 boxes per night of effort. 3-4 on a full Saturday. With 15 days of straight effort (plan for it!). Aim for 50 boxes pwned in 30 days and you are in a good spot to pass. Do not go straight into the exam! Post PWK Pre-Exam Prep Do you know microsoft word really well? If not go learn it. You have 24 hours post lab to write a report. If you are young and new, this is a gap. Install greenshot, learn how it works and inverts colors etc. Practice saving the screenshots and pasting them into a document, etc. You will take many many screenshots. Go do as much of TJ Null's HTB list as you can stand. I did 90% of it. Review privesc. Review privesc. Review your weaknesses. Then review them again. Review the OSCP exam rules, the proctoring info, etc. Make checklists of what you need to submit, and how. Understand the rules really really well. SNAPSHOT your vm when it is in a good state. Trust me on this. My VM went borked right before the exam. I reverted to a working snapshot easily. Now go and do tryhackme's buffer overflow room. This is all you need to do. Exam time Take the exam. Get some rest. Don't go into rabbit holes.
