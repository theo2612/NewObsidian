# Trust and Policies 
* Help the domain and trees communicate with each other and maintain security inside the network
* put rules in place of 
	* how the domains inside the forest can interact with each other
	* how an external forest can interact with the forest 
	* the overall domain rules or policies that a domain must follow
**Domain Trusts Overview**
*Trusts* 
* A mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain
* outline the way that domains inside of a forest communicate to each other, in some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases
**Two types of trusts** that determine how the domains communicate.
* *Directional* the direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
* *Transitive* The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains

**Domain Policies Overview**
* Domain Policies contain rules that apply to the domain as a whole
* They act as a rulebook for Active Directory that a domain admin can modify to keep the network running smoothly and securely
* Domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller 
	* Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machines on the domain
	* Digitally sign communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller
