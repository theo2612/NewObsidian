Need mac to develop an iOS game

# Game app, called the alphabet game. 
- The game starts at 'A' and as user traveling on foot, bike, car, etc would look for signs, billboards, or any other road sign that have words that start with 'A' and take a picture. 
- The picture would be analyzed by the app for validity and if it detects an 'A' it moves to the letter 'B'. 
- I want to create user accounts that will save user game data. 
- I want to allow the alphabet to loop back to 'A' after the user gets to 'Z'. 
- Scoreboards for country, state, city
- can be played privately, locally or massively
- Add easter Egg 'Rosie Theodore is the best' (that's me)
- make it in python/godot

# Consider making a side scroller game that generates signs where the user has to tap on the word on the sign to advance the alphabet

Creating a game like the Alphabet Game in Python is a great idea! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Set up your development environment:
	- Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website (python.org).
	- 
2. Choose a game development framework:
	- Consider using a game development framework like Pygame or Kivy. Pygame is a popular choice for 2D game development, while 
	- **Godot**
	- **Kivy is suitable for both 2D and 3D games. These frameworks provide useful tools and functionality to simplify game development.**
	- **Unity Visual Scripting: Flow Canvas**
1. Create the game structure:
	- Define the main components of your game, such as the game loop, player movement, and scoring system.
	- Initialize the game window and any necessary graphical elements using the chosen framework.
2. Implement user accounts and data storage:
	- Decide on a method for user account creation and data storage. You can use a database or file-based system to store user data such as game progress and scores.
	- Use Python's built-in database modules (e.g., SQLite3) or external libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to handle data storage and retrieval.
3. Implement image analysis for letter detection:
	- Research and choose a computer vision library for image processing and analysis, such as OpenCV or scikit-image.
	- Train a machine learning model (e.g., using a Convolutional Neural Network) to recognize letters or use pre-trained models for letter detection.
	- Use the selected library to process the images captured by the user, analyze them for the presence of the target letter, and determine their validity.
4. Define game rules and mechanics:
	- Establish the rules and mechanics of your game. For example, decide on the scoring system, time limits, and any penalties for incorrect captures.
	- Determine how the game progresses from one letter to the next, including looping back to 'A' after reaching 'Z'.
5. Implement gameplay logic:
	- Write the code that handles user input, captures images, performs the image analysis, and updates the game state accordingly.
	- Develop the logic for transitioning between letters, updating scores, and tracking player progress.
	- Implement any additional features, such as power-ups or bonuses, to enhance the gameplay experience.
6. Test and debug:
	- Thoroughly test your game to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
	- Debug your code and ensure that all game features work as intended.
7. Polish and finalize:    
	- Add graphics, sound effects, and music to enhance the visual and auditory experience of the game.
	- Implement a user-friendly interface and consider adding features like high scores, achievements, or leaderboards.
