let the form submit to its original location but add an event listener on the form submit that takes the values and submits them to your third party url

might be able to utilize a throwaway thing like ( a stackblitz project) to get a simple https uri to post to.

you could also create the fields as input="text" and when the user starts typing you could change it to type="password" with js
