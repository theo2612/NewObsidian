	- 20% is about how you do it
		- How? using the memory methods
	- Take responsibility - simple as having a reason and making a decision that you want to change your belief about your bad memory

2. Question the belief
	- There are somethings in the past that you believed with all your heart, that now you don't believe them
		- why? because you questioned them. 
	- How much will this belief cost me if I hold on to it?
	- Do I have to hold on to it?
	- Is it true?
	- Can I be 100% certain it is the truth?

3. Create a new belief and think of experiences, research and thoughts to confirm it.
	- When you change your beliefs you allow yourself to experience more of your potential and create new possibilities.
