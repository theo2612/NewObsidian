## ISO 27001 #card
sets foundational standard for Information security Management Systems (ISMS)

## ISO 27002 #card 
defines Information security controls

## ISO 27701
defines privacy and extends ISO 27001 & 27002 standards to include detailed management or PII (personally identifiable Information)

## ISO 31000
defines risk over all of the below sets international standards for risk management

## MTBF
Mean time between failure
## RTO
Recovery time objectives
## MTTR
Mean time to restore
## MTTF
mean time to failure
## EAP-TLS
Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport Layer Security allows the use of multiple authentication protocols transported inside of an encrypted TLS (transport layer security) tunnel. 
## PEAP
(Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) encapsulate EAP within a TLS tunnel, but does not provide a method of encapsulating other authentication methods
## EAP-TTLS
Does not provide a mechanism for using multiple types within a TLS tunnel.
D. EAP-MSCHAPv2 - (EAP - Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication protocol v2) is a common implementation of PEAP
## Race Conditions
A race condition occurs when two processes occur at similar times, usually with unexpected results. 
## SED
Self-Encrypting Drive provides data protection of a storage device using full-disk encryption in the drive hardware
## CASB
Cloud Access Security Broker is a solution for administering and managing security policies in the cloud. CASB will not provide and security for data stored on laptops and other mobile devices
## MAC
Mandatory Access Control is an access control system that assigns labels to objects in an operating system. MAC would not prevent external access to data on a laptop's stor/page drive.
## SOAR
Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response describes a process for automating security activities. SOAR would not provide a mechanism for protecting data on a laptops storage drive.
## MDM
Mobile Device Manager provides a centralized management system for all mobile devices. From this central console, security administrators can set policies for many different types of mobile devices
## Containerization
mobile device containerization allows an organization to securely separate user data from company data on a mobile device. Implementing this strategy usually requires a mobile device manager (MDM), and containerization alone won't address all of the required security policies
## COPE
 a COPE / Corporately Owned and Personally Enabled is commonly purchased by the corporation and allows the use of the mobile device for both business and personal use.
## VDI
a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure separates the applications from the mobile device or device.
## Geofencing
could be used to prevent mobile device use from other countries, but you still need a MDM to implement the other requirements
## False negative
is a result that fails to detect an issue when one actually exists
## 802.1X
uses a centralized authentication server, and all users can use their normal credentials to authenticate to an 802.1X network
## WPA2-PSK 
PSK is the shared password that this network administration would like to avoid using in the future
## WPS
Wi-Fi protected setup connects users to a wireless network using a shared PIN or personal identification number
## WPA2-AES
WPA2 or Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 encryption with AES or Advances Encryption Standard is a common encryption method for wireless networks but it does not provide any centralized authentication functionality.
## DAC
Discretionary Access Control is used in many operating systems and this model allows the owner of the resource to control who has access.
