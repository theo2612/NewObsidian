ISO 27001 - sets foundational standard for Information security Management Systems (ISMS)
ISO 27002 - defines Information security controls
ISO 27701 - defines privacy and extends ISO 27001 & 27002 standards to include detailed management or PII (personally identifiable Information)
ISO 31000 - defines risk over all of the below sets international standards for risk management

A. MTBF - Mean time between failure
B. RTO - Recovery time objectives
C. MTTR - Mean time to restore
D. MTTF - mean time to failure

A. EAP-TLS - Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport Layer Security allows the use of multiple authentication protocols transported inside of an encrypted TLS (transport layer security) tunnel. 
B. PEAP - (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) encapsulate EAP within a TLS tunnel, but does not provide a method of encapsulating other authentication methods
C. EAP-TTLS - Does not provide a mechanism for using multiple types within a TLS tunnel.
D. EAP-MSCHAPv2 - (EAP - Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication protocol v2) is a common implementation of PEAP

Race Conditions - A race condition occurs when two processes occur at similar times, usually with unexpected results. 

SED - Self-Encrypting Drive provides data protection of a storage device using full-disk encryption in the drive hardware

CASB - Cloud Access Security Broker is a solution for administering and managing security policies in the cloud. CASB will not provide and security for data stored on laptops and other mobile devices

MAC - Mandatory Access Control is an access control system that assigns labels to objects in an operating system. MAC would not prevent external access to data on a laptop's storage drive.

SOAR - Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response describes a process for automating security activities. SOAR would not provide a mechanism for protecting data on a laptops storage drive.

MDM - Mobile Device Manager provides a centralized management system for all mobile devices. From this central console, security administrators can set policies for many different types of mobile devices

Containerization - mobile device containerization allows an organization to securely separate user data from company data on a mobile device. Implementing this strategy usually requires a mobile device manager (MDM), and containerization alone won't address all of the required security policies

COPE - a COPE / Corporately Owned and Personally Enabled is commonly purchased by the corporation and allows the use of the mobile device for both business and personal use.

VDI - a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure separates the applications from the mobile device or device.

Geofencing - could be used to prevent mobile device use from other countries, but you still need a MDM to implement the other requirements

False negative - is a result that fails to detect an issue when one actually exists
