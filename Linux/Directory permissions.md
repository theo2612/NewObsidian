"Execute" is the _traversal_ permission on a directory. It allows you to access files and folders within the directory.

If you can _read_ a directory, you can list the contents.

If you can _write_ a directory, you can make new files and folders within it.

If you can _execute_ a directory, you can move through the hierarchy, even if you don't know what's inside.
