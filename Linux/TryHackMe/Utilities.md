Serving files from your host  
Ubuntu comes pre-packaged with python3 that comes with a module called â€œHTTPServer"  
this module turns you computer into a quick webserver that you can use to serve files.  
they can then be downloaded by another machine using curl and wget  
$ python3 -m http.server  
#starts the module  
  
$ wget [http://127.0.0.1:8000/file](http://127.0.0.1:8000/file)  
#retrieves file from 127.0.0.1  
  
$ curl -vv [http://securitylive.com](http://securitylive.com)  
#retrives request and response headers and cipher headers with full verbosity.  
  
-d  
#sends the request as a post  
  
-H  
#send additional headers: -H =Host
