#### Private IPv4 Addresses
 - Used for network communication on the internal network
 - Referred to as an RFC1918 IP address
 - Internal or private IP addresses are not reachable by external devices over the internet
 - These IP address ranges can be used on multiple networks, and not reachable through the internet
 - Network Address Translation (NAT) server is used to facilitate communication externally 
 - NAT server can be a router or firewall which translates the the private IP to a public IP to ensure external communication.
 - NAT server will have a limited number of public IP addresses assigned to it, which minimizes the use of these public IP addresses 
 - Port Address Translation (PAT) is utilized to reduce the use of public IP addresses. 
 - Multiple devices can connect to the internet using only one public IP address for communication. PAT is used by routers to facilitate communication.
