```bash

Hash-mode was not specified with -m. Attempting to auto-detect hash mode.
The following mode was auto-detected as the only one matching your input hash:

1800 | sha512crypt $6$, SHA512 (Unix) | Operating System

NOTE: Auto-detect is best effort. The correct hash-mode is NOT guaranteed!
Do NOT report auto-detect issues unless you are certain of the hash type.has

- crack hash based on hash type and output to the terminal 
 `hashcat -a 0 -m hash id# hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
```bash
