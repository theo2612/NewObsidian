socket statistics

```bash
$ ss -tulpn
```
- a rundown of all the TCP and UDP sockets that are currently listening on your system, along with the associated processes, and all in a neat, numeric format.
 - `ss`: Short for "socket statistics," it's a command-line utility to investigate sockets on a system, displaying information about network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
    
- `-tulpn`: This is where the real magic happens:
    
    - `-t`: Filters the output to show only TCP sockets. Think of it as focusing your lens on TCP connections, ignoring everything else.
    - `-u`: Similarly, this filter narrows the output to UDP sockets. Like the 't' flag, but for UDP. Handy if you're into datagrams.
    - `-l`: Limits the display to only listening sockets. These are the ones that are open and waiting for incoming connections. Like a phone line waiting for a call.
    - `-p`: Shows the process using the socket. This flag reveals which program or service is responsible for each socket. It's like peeking behind the curtain to see who's pulling the strings.
    - `-n`: Displays numeric addresses instead of resolving them to hostnames. This can speed up the command's execution and make the output more concise. No need for fancy names, just raw numbers.
