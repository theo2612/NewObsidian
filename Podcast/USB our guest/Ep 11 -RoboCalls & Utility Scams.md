 Hello. Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. Thank you for adding us to your Flash Briefing.

 Today's tip is about Utility company scam calls. The Federal Trade Commision has an excellent article on their blog about protecting yourself from this scam. The website is listed in the show notes

 The fraudsters will call to inform you that your utility bill is past due and unless you pay immediately, a random dollar amount around $1000, your power will be shut off. 

 The author outlines a few warning signs to be aware of.

 1. If you know you already paid, don't budge. The scammer can be very perstistent. 2. The Scammer may demand banking details by email or phone. Utility companies won't demand payment by phone as your only option. 3. Some scammers offer odd payment channels like apple i-tunes gift cards, cash reload cards, wire transfers or cryptocurrency. Your legitimate utility company doesn't generally accept payment in this form.

 The blog continues with the following suggestions

 1. If you can't remember if you paid your bill or are concerned it is past due. Hang up and call the Utility phone number listed on your bill. 

 2. Never give banking deatils over the phone unless you place the call to the utility company from the number on your bill.

 3. Report it to the Federal Trade Commission. A link to the FTC Complaint Assistant is in the show notes

 Thank you again for listening and we'll talk to you again tomorrow.
