 Hey There. Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. Thank you for adding us to your Flash Briefing.

 Todays tip is about Virtual Private Networks or VPN's. There is a great article on the PC Magazine website that will be listed in the show notes. The article really dives deep into VPN's if you want more in-depth info. It's a long read but almost eveything you need to know about a VPN is in there. For today we are going to cover a high overview of what a VPN is and why you need to consider using one. 

 So, What is a VPN?

 Think of the connection from your computer to your router and to the website's server you are visiting as a clear tube. If you are in a coffee shop and connected to a fake WiFi hotspot, a Cyber Criminal can see every piece of data you are sending through that tunnel. Websites you are visiting, Login credentials, medical info and your secret Spice Girls playlist on Spotify. 

 While connected to a VPN, this clear tube becomes cast iron pipe where all of your data is encrypted. No one can see your data transmitting until your data enters the public internet. and as long as you are visiting websites with HTTPS in the beginning of their address your data stay encrypted. 

 Why should you use a VPN? 

 1. To protect your info if even after scrutinizig the coffee shops public WiFi you inadvertantly connect to malicious one. A VPN will Encrypt your traffic while connected to a faked WiFi. Although this is not recommended for any amount of time. 

 2. With new the FCC changing Net Neutrality rules Internet service providers or ISP can now see and sell your browsing history. A VPN will encrypt all of your traffic from your ISP.

 3. In regard to Net Neutrality again, Internet Service Providers are now allowed to offer ultra fast content to some companies for a price and throttle or slow down others. If Netflix hasn't paid for fast lanes then a VPN may not allow your ISP to see and throttle your 11th hour Stranger Things Binge.

 The article also has links to popular free and paid VPN.
