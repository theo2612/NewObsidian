 Hello and thank you for taking the time to listen to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. It's a great way to help protect yourself from cyber attacks

 Todays's topic is about Ransomware. KnowBe4 has a great, up to date article on today's tip and a link to it will be in the show notes.

 Ransomware is malware that encrypts your data on your device and then demands payment 

 It usually infects your computer through a phishing scam. If you don't know what phishing is, please go back through our feed, as we covered it in a previous episode. Phishing attacks are meant to trick you into clicking on a link or visiting a website that downloads malware to your computer.

 There are other more aggressive ways for hackers to infect your system with malware, where they exploit security holes in your computers programs installed. However, typically, keeping your computer current with security updates wil keep you safe from this attack method

 After the Ransomware is running on your computer it encrypts all of the data, which are all of the files on your computer; documents, photos, videos, games applications and/or games. all of it

 Then it usually adds a text file to your desktop or changes your desktop background for instructions on how to pay the ransom, typically by BitCoin, for access to the ransom key. 

 The easiest way to recover from a Ransomware attack is to do daily backups of you computer. We'll cover backups on the next episode. 

 Unfortunately, the Ransomware problem isn't getting any better. The cyber criminals are aware that many systems get backed and less people are paying ransoms. So, they are adjusting their attack methods by destroying backups, stealing personal info, and exposing victims by leaking stolen data. 

 The easiest way for you to avoid a Ransomware attack is by not clicking on suspicious link or visiting a suspicious website.

 That all for today except for a Friendly reminder. If you like what we are doing here please take a minute to rate and review us on whatever podcast platform you are using. 

 Thank you again for listening and we'll talk again soon

 Since recording the Ransomware episode I came accross an article by Sophos aboutÂ  how the bad guys are using virtual machines to hide their malware's malicious intent. Please find the link to the article in the show notes. The article is a deep dive but the point that should be taken is that this new tactic is making it harder for your computer to detect these threats. Your computer may not warn you like it usually does if you encounter this strain. Again, the best defense against this attack is by not clicking on suspicious links or not visiting suspicious websites. Thank you again for listening
