18 Backups How and Why should I backup my computer?

 Hello. Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. Thank you for adding us to your Routine. Today's episode is about Backups

 There is a great article on PC mag that goes in depth on backing up your PC. I'll include the web address in the show notes. https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-beginners-guide-to-pc-backup 

 I'll also include another link in the show notes to a Microsoft support article titled "Backup and Restore in Windows 10"Â  - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027408/windows-10-backup-and-restore

 What is a backup? It is a second copy of all your important files - photos, videos, documents or any file on your computer that is an original. A backup is a copy of these items, only in another place, not your computer. 

 There is a 3-2-1 backup rule that states, keep 3 copies of your backups, 2 copies on different storage devices, and 1 copy located offsite. 

 Different storage devices as in an external hard drive. Western digitial or seagate make external hard drives in sizes as small as a few hundred Gigabytes and as large as multiple Terrabytes. 

 The 3-2-1 rule can be overwhelming. In my opinion, just start with a single backup of your files on an external drive. Just don't stop there. Add additonal layers of protection when you have the ability to do so.

 Why should you backup your data? Because daily backups can help you recover from a Ransomware attack. If for instance, your PC happens to become infected, you can either pay the ransom, which can be $500 or more in bitcoin or restore your files from a last nights back-up, for free.

 That's all for this episode except for a friendly reminder. Please take a minute to rate and review the show on what ever platform you use to listen. Also, If I'm helping you please let others know what I'm doing here. 

 Thank you for listening and I'll talk to you again soon.
