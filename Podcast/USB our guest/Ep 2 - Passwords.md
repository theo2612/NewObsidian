[Knowbe4 blog - 5 easy steps to create strong passwords](https://blog.knowbe4.com/bid/352493/5-easy-steps-to-create-strong-passwords)

 Hey there. Thanks. Really appreciate you adding 'USB our Guest, cyber security tips' to your flash briefing.

 Today's Tip is about passwords

 Avoid writing down your passwords. Instead Use a password Manager.

 Do not share your password with anyone, keep them private

 Passwords should be 8 characters or longer; longer means more secure.

 Include special characters, upper and lower case letters, and numbers in all passwords; more complex means more secure.

 Do not use people's names or words found in a dictionary. Cyber criminals have tools that perform something called a dictionary attack. This is when a file of common words, as found in a dictionary, are used as passwords while trying to gain access to an account. 

 Do not substitute look-alike symbols for letters. Cyber criminals are savvy to (An at sign in place of an a) or (dollar sign for a S). 

 a Secure Password should look like an incoherent random group of letters, numbers and special characters

 If you think someone has your password change it immediately

 Finally, STOP Reusing passwords. If someone gets a hold of your one password for all of your accounts then they have access to all of your info online. Bank accounts, social media, medical info. Cleaning up an attack as devastating as this will take a long time.
