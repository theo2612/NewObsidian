20 "haveibeenpwned.com" Hello and welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security tips. Thank you for taking a few minutes out of you day to listen. It's a great way to help protect yourself from cyber-attacks. Today's episode covers the website https://haveibeenpwned.com. 

 Home Depot, Target, LinkedIn, Adobe, Ancestry.com, Coachella, Dominos, Epic Games, My Fitness Pal, Patreon, Sephora, Snapchat, Sony, and Yahoo. If you have had an account with one of these companies chances are your username and passwords combinations or credentials have been bought and sold numerous times. With all of the breaches that have happened it can be hard to understand if or how you have been affected. Where can you go to find out? 

 Excellent question, Troy Hunt created haveibeenpwned as a free resource for anyone to check just how many of your online acocunts have been compromised in a data breach. All of the data on this website comes from breaches where data is exposed to people that should not be able to view it.

 According Troy he built the site as a service to the public. Data breaches are rampant and many don't realize how large or how often they occur. He wanted to bring all of the data to one place where people could search for their compromised accounts.

 So how does it work? all you have to do is type in your emial address and click the 'pwned?' button. You'll then be presented with a list of all the breaches where your username, email and/or password hav been compromised. From there, my advice would be to change these credentials immediately. A great place to start is with a password manager. feel free to scroll back to episode 4 for a few to check out.

 That all for today.
