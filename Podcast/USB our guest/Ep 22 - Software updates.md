Hello and welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security tips. Thank you for taking a few minutes out of your day to listen. Arming yourself with knowledge is the best way to help protect yourself from cyber-attacks. Today's episode covers Software updates. Norton antivirus has a great article titled, 5 reasons why general software updates are important. I'll add it to the show notes.

 It often seems like we are often asked by our devices to install the latest software or download the latest update. You may have found the most efficient way to snooze or ignore these reminders, and While the notifications feel burdensome, the update is often in your best interest to install. Here's why...

 Revisions. Software developers often are looking for ways to improve layouts, remove less used features or speed up their software. Revisions may include these changes. 

 Updates. The update may include a fix for a reported bug that crashes the app or program or a patch for security flaws. For example, In may 2017 The WannaCrypt/WannaCry Ransomware attack infected Microsoft Windows machines. These machines were either running an old version of Windows no longer supported by Microsoft or they were not updated with current patches to protect from this exploit. WannaCry Ransomware then demanded $300-$600 in bitcoin per machine to decrypt files or they would be deleted

 Your Data. Our devices /computers, tablets, phones, gaming systems/ all have more data saved on them than ever before. Updating your software, keeps the security up to date, therefore keeping your data more safe than on an updated system. 

 Other People's Devices. If your device becomes infected there is a good chance that you could pass the virus on to family, friends or business contacts. Keeping you device updated can help protect it from cyber attacks

 Finally, if you still are too busy or too annoyed with having to update your devices manually consider scheduling your devices to update themselves. Computers, tablets, and smart phones all have settings that schedule updates during downtime or overnight while they are charging and you are sleeping. If you schedule updates just right, you'll never have to do them yourself again
