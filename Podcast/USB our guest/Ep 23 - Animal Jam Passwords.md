23 Rosie Animal Jam Passwords 

Hello and Welcome back to USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips. I hope you enjoyed the Holidays and The New Year even if it looked a little different due to COVID. A Couple thank yous upfront. First off, Thank you for listening - I couldn't believe the stats when I read them but USB our Guest recently passed 1000 listens. Also, Thank you for keeping me in your Podcast rotation - With so many good podcasts to listen to I'm honored to be in your mix. So that being said, off we go - I was able to spend a lot of time off with my family over the Holidays so I decided to switch it up a little bit and do an exclusive interview. I had the chance to sit down with my daughter Rosie to talk about the game Animal Jam and Passwords and was delightfully surprised when she dropped a couple truth bombs. She is wise beyond her years. The Full interview is 9 min long but well worth it. Enjoy
