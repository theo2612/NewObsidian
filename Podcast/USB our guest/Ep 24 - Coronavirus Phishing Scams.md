 I could have done an episode on this a while ago but I feel it is just as relevant now. With the release of a couple vaccines and more to come, stimulus payments and contact tracing calls the opportunity for scammers to try and fool you out of your money or personal Identifiable Info is high. Today we'll be covering what to be on the lookout for and how to protect yourself. 

 First of all, No legitimate contact tracer requires payment, your social security number, immigration status or your financial info. Anyone who says otherwise is a scammer. Also, They may send you a text stating they will be calling you but they shouldn't be sending you anything to click on. Consider clickable links or requests to  download anything to be a scam. 

 Next, Consult,   irs.gov/  for info regarding stimulus payments. Any info coming from text, email, Robocalls, facebook, twitter, tiktok, Instagram, MySpace, your favorite influencer or that guy at the bar that knows everything should not be taken seriously. besides, what are you doing at the bar right now...

 Ignore offers for miracle treatments or cures. Each state is responsible for their own rollout of vaccinations. At the time of this recording, Ohio had started vaccinating people 80 years or older. They have a schedule on their official Ohio.gov department of health website. 

 This is a quick episode meant to reinforce what you should already know. Be skeptical with any information if it is not coming from an official source. How do you know it's an official source? call your local health department, visit irs.gov , ftc.gov and start there.
