25 Robocalls with Dominic 

  

Hello and Welcome back to USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips. One month in and I Hope you are enjoying 2021. 

 Today's Episode is an interview with my son Dominic. I had the chance to sit down and talk to him about Robo-calls. It was very interesting to hear Dominic's take on Robo-calls considering his phone number is fairly new. He's already heard robo-call scams regarding so-called Credit Card, Utility and Car Insurance companies. I was very impressed with how he has a healthy dose of scepticism when receiving Robo-calls, which is good because almost every Robo-Call you receive lately is a scam. As you'll hear in our conversation, never give someone from a Robo-call your personal identifiable info, Credit Card numbers or Bank account numbers. We also cover something called Personal 2 factor authentication. 

This episode again is a little longer, about 9 min, but well worth it
