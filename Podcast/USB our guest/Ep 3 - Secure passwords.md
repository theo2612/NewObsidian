 Hey, How's it going? Thanks for adding "USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips" to your flash briefing

 Today's tip about creating passwords comes from KnowBe4. They are experts in preventing social engineering.  Find them online at 'k n o w' , the letters 'b e', and the number 4. com. 

 2. Remove all letters excerpts for the 1st letter of each word -  TCBTTMWIITA

 3. Repace some of the letters with lower case versions -now I have TcBTtmWIiTA

 4. Substitute a number for at least one of the letters. In this case I replaced the 1st upper case I with a 1  - TcBTtmW1iTA

 5. Lastly use special characters, such as $, &, +, !, @, to replace a couple letters. It's a good idea to replace a letter that may be repeated. Also feel free to add an additional special character - I used a + for the second T, an @ for the A and added a $ at the end. I'm left with TcB+tmW1iT@$, a completely incoherent random group of letters, numbers and special characters.

 Also, knowbe4 suggests to check your password at https://howsecureismypassword.net/. Enter your password and it will tell you how long it would take a computer to crack you password. You want it to tell you a computer would need over a few million years to crack your password. If your password is anything less, keep adding special characters to the end until it goes up.

 Thank you stopping by and I'll see you here tomorrow
