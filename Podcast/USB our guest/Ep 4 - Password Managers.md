 Hello.Â  Thanks for adding "USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips" to your flash briefing. 

 Today's Tips about password managers comes from wired magazine. Links to the article and password managers are in the show notes. 

 If you are as tired as I am trying to memorize passwords then today's tip is exactly what you are looking for. 

 Password managers make all of the difficult tasks around passwords much easier.

 Once you create a very secure password for you password manager, that will be the only one you'll need to rememeber to access all of your other passwords

 A good password manager will store, create, update all of you passwords and log you in to your accounts online

 Most password managers will have eco-system of apps, browser extensions, and cloud storage where your passwords are encrypted and stored for all of your devices to access

 The 3 of the cloud based password managers mentioned in this article all have functionality to identify your potentially compromised passwords and prompt you to make them more secure

 On a side note, the author does suggest disabling auto form filling to help prevent an auto form filling attack that has happened in the past. If you currently use a password manager please consider doing this.

 If you are reusing passwords, just get started by using a password manager and consider disabling this feature in the future.

 Thank you again for listening and we'll talk to you again on Monday.
