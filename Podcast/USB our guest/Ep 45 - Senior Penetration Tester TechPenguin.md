Hello and welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security tips. 
Iâ€™m Theo, here to help you break down cyber security news and hacks and how they affect you. However, today I am interviewing Tech Penguin who is a Senior Penetration Tester
We recorded the interview in an open discord voice channel with video while monitoring chat with Text-to-speech developed by Security_Live. 
The Tech Penguin has 5 years experience as a penetration tester with an different entry to Cyber Security and We are very excited to talk to him.
Also, I send people I interview a list of questions to answer, and the Tech Penguin did that, offering well thought and honest answers. Find the document linked on the episode page, on my Github.  This is a little longer than my normal format so feel free to speed it up. Thank you for listening and enjoy.
