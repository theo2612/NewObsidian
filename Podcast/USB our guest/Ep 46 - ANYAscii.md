- Who are you? 
	- background - as much or little as you are comfortable with. 
		- "I'm a *Linux Administrator in HPC/Research Computing* with a background that's taken many twists and turns. As a kid, I was drawn to filmmaking and the arts but was later steered towards careers that required analytical skills and big-picture thinking. I initially studied economics and political science in university and worked in various roles, including IT recruiting and accounts payable. However, my journey took a turn when I returned to university, began work in desktop support, and truly discovered a passion for technology. Now I realize that passion was present earlier than I thought."
	- What is your current role? 
		- "I currently work as a Linux Administrator in HPC/Research Computing, where I manage and support high-performance computing systems used for research and scientific computing."
		- "I work as a Linux Administrator in HPC/Research Computing, managing high- performance computing systems for research. My tasks include cluster management, SLURM scheduler optimization, parallel file system management, RHEL 8 server configuration, LAMP stack utilization for web services, networking troubleshooting, user support, bash scripting for automation, and infrastructure design for optimal HPC performance. I also spend time in the data center for routine maintenance and to install and  deploy state-of-the-art architecture. For example, we recently received state-of-the-art NVIDIA AI superchips called the 'Grace Hopper' boxes in the data center. This was my first time working with such equipment and helping to install Linux on the box."
	- location - "I live in the United States and work in academia."
	- age - "You know, they say 'never ask a woman her age and a man his salary' (but seriously, I am in my mid-30s)."
	- previous jobs -"Before my current role in HPC/Linux, I worked odd jobs in IT recruiting, administration, and accounts payable. Eventually, I entered IT in an entry-level desktop support role and spent a few years grinding it out in application layer support. In these various jobs, I gained valuable skills in communication, organization, and problem-solving that I continue to utilize today."
	- scripting lang? - 
		- "I regularly use scripting languages like Python and Bash to automate tasks and streamline processes in my role."
		- "Also learned visual C# in university, toyed around with Golang and Rust projects (mostly on Twitch), and basically whatever tickles my fancy."
- What is your education level (or lack of)
	- "I have a bachelor's degree in economics and political science, but I've also pursued additional education and certifications in IT and cybersecurity to further my career." 
	- "I have formal university education in Information Technology and Systems. Additionally, I am considering going back to graduate school, a long-time goal of mine, to further enhance my knowledge and skills in the HPC field (which values academia/traditional education more than other areas of tech)."
- What have you taught yourself?
	- "I've taught myself various skills that have been instrumental in my career journey, including blue/red teaming cybersecurity concepts, scripting/programming  languages, the foundations of Linux and networking through self-study and hands- on experience (with a good portion streamed live on Twitch). "While working as a sourcer/recruiter, I was sourcing for a Linux Kernel Development position. This experience exposed me to the fascinating world of Linux and kernel development, sparking a deep interest in the field. Additionally, my earlier hobbyism in GPG/PGP cryptography, which I pursued without realizing its significance at the time, led me to explore encryption methods and Linux systems. It was only in hindsight that I realized these experiences were early indicators of my interest in technology. These  experiences have taught me the value of continuous learning and self-improvement in the ever-evolving field of technology."
- How important are certs?
	- "Researching certifications has been crucial in my career development. While I do no actually have any IT certifications, I sure have studied for my fair share! I believe, from my research/experience, that obtaining certifications depends on one's role and the existing job market. It's important to do your due diligence to verify that the certification will test the skills relevant to your job and must discern whether the vendor is reputable. 
	- "Also, you need to make personal decisions regarding your finances that, in my experience, no one can actually make for you. Again, do an effective analysis of the other aspects I mentioned (vendor, etc.). Unfortunately, I have known too many people who have been sold a bill of goods on certifications and things like bootcamps that never actually pay off. So please be careful out there! 
	- "In HPC/Linux, formal education is valued over certifications. However, when I was working in desktop support, certifications like A+ and Network+ would've been ideal for advancement in that area.
	- *"Trusted vendor, affordable so would've been worthwhile."*
- How you did you land your job in cyber security to get in the industry?
	- "I landed my job in HPC/Linux through a combination of unique opportunities,
		networking, and my educational background. I saw an internal opening at my
		organization for the role and thought it would be a great fit for me. I consulted with my mentor, a former professor, and a high-ranking member of the organization I worked for, who encouraged me to pursue it. Despite having a subpar interview, I was hired, partly due to my past work with the organization as a desktop support worker, the great references I received from getting to know co-workers who were also promoted, and my Twitch streams/content that showed I had ability greater than what I could articulate while nervous in the interview. My second stint in university, where I took a course in Linux Administration, also played a significant role in preparing me for this
		career path."
- How necessary is Building Relationships/Networking? LinkedIn, Discord, in person? 
	- "Building relationships and networking have been crucial in my career progression. Platforms like LinkedIn and Discord have helped me connect with like-minded 	professionals and expand my professional network. In fact, I would not have my current positions without networking. The majority of positions are filled internally and will never be posted to a site such as LinkedIn. 
	- "The main thing about networking is you need to evaluate your strengths and determine where you excel. For example, if you are a great writer and work in web development, perhaps it would be best to develop your own site with a blog section. Or you can write blog entries on Medium or Substack that showcase your knowledge and ability. If you are excellent with project-based work and development, then build a portfolio and GitHub. LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., are simply vehicles to share this work. 
	- "Personally, learning live on Twitch works well for me and, in conjunction with Strong in-person networking, led to my current path."
- The importance of stepping out of your comfort zone?
	- "Stepping outside of your comfort zone is crucial for personal and professional growth. There are entire areas of psychology dedicated to helping individuals leave their comfort zones and enter their growth zones. In an ever-changing sector like technology, it's especially important to be constantly learning and adapting.
	- "In addition to being invested in constant learning, whether through formal education, certifications, or self-study, it's important to develop the skills to handle stepping outside your comfort zone.
	- "This involves evaluating your strengths, avoiding giving in to self-doubt or imposter syndrome, and keeping an open mind about areas where you can improve and how you can move forward. Embracing discomfort can lead to new opportunities and growth that may not have been possible otherwise.
	- "By the way, doing this interview is outside of my current zone."
- What are your employers expectations in your current role?
	- "Effectively manage and maintain HPC systems, collaborate with researchers and teammates, and stay updated on emerging technologies in the field." 
	- "It is a niche area and close-knit environment, so reinforcing those bonds is particularly  Important but I think that very much carries to other sectors of tech."
- What is advice that you wish  you knew when you started on your path in Linux/HPC?
	- "Looking back, I wish I knew earlier in my career the value of networking, continuous learning, and the diverse paths available in technology careers. My early interest I working with GPG/PGP during university, for example, opened my eyes to the world of cryptography and Linux but it would take me years to realize this was indicative of a deeper interest in technology. These insights have been invaluable as I've navigated my journey in HPC/Linux administration."
	- "I also wish I had not written off STEM earlier in my life and would encourage people to be more open-minded about their abilities. The recent Linux workshop reinforce this, as there were as many paths to HPC/Linux as there were people at the conference."
	- *"Additionally, I wish I knew earlier that it was okay to fail and to try again. Very few people can immediately grasp a concept and replicate those steps in a work  environment. with the right mindset, you can learn from failure and be stronger for it.*
	- "Finally, it's important to know your worth as a worker. Ultimately, a company needs your labor and you have more bargaining power than you may think."
