 Hello.Â  Welcome back and Thanks for adding "USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips" to your flash briefing. 

 Today's Tip is about 2 factor authentication, Also refered to as 2FA, comes from Trend Micro. A link to the article and 2 factor apps are in the show notes. 

 In addition to good password hygenie 2 Factor Authentication is another layer of security that you can add in case Cyber thieves somehow get a hold of your username and password. 

 2 Factor authentication works by requiring you to enter in an authenication token from another channel to verify, in fact you are trying to access your account. With 2FA you'll need a second factor (something you know (like your mothers maiden name), something you have (like a token) or are (like your fingerprint)) 

 For this tip we are focusing on phone based tokens that are sent to you via text message and app based tokens that expire after use or constantly change. 

 Many of the accounts that you may have such as Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Snapchat already have 2 factor authentication available to use. If an account has it, enable it.

 Once activated they will ask you preference or require you to supply both, phone number and email. 

 Then, if you log in from an unrecognized device or if someone else does, like say a hacker, you or they will be prompted for a second factor such as a token sent to your phone or email. 

 If you are not using an unrecognized device and you receive a notification like this, then it is safe to say that someone is trying to access your account. Report this immediately to the acocunt you are signed up for. 

 Thank you again for listening and we'll talk to you again tomorrow.
