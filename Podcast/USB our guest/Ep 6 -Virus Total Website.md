 Hello and Welcome back to "USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips". Thank you for adding us to your flash briefing. 

 Today's tip is about the utilizing the website VirusTotal. A Link to their website is in the show notes

 VirusTotal has a multi-purpose website dedicated to, Analyzing files and URLS to detect types of malware and share them with the security community.

 If you come accross a suspicious file or website, you can upload or paste the URL to the VirusTotal website. 

 I often will use this if I'm given a website to check out from a friend or after I download a file that I find a little suspect. 

 VirusTotal cross references your upload with 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blacklisting services. 

 After VirusTotal is done analyzing, you will be taken to a results page. Anything listed in Red may indicate that the file or URL is malicious and should be deleted or avoided.

 Use VirusTotal as a tool to keep you computer virus free. 

 Thank you again for listening and we'll talk to you again tomorrow.
