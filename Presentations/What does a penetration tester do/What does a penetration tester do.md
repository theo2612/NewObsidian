## ME
I'm Brad Theodore but before I tell you about me and Pen Testing. 
---


My Wife
**Amy**. She's a saint. They got a cloud waiting for her. She's seen me at my absolute best and worst and keeps me. Our family is one of the most inspiring forces in my life.

Our 2 kids. **Dominic and Rosie**
**Dominic** 
He runs cross country and track and has almost lettered in both and has a 4.0 currently.

**Rosie** 
She consumes books like I consume Reese's cups, quickly. She swims and plays soccer. Well not really play, she is an animal out there, not afraid of someone bigger than her. In fact, I'm pretty sure she looks for em. Yeah.

**And me** 
- I have a bachelors in Hospitality Management from YSU
- I have a masters in Information Technology with a concentration in Cyber Security. I did a lot of academic paper reading and hands on work. but truth be told a lot of my actual hands on experience came after university.
- I've worked in the Restaurant, Beverage and Trucking industries. I firmly believe that my time spent in those industries has prepared me for my career in Cyber Security. 
- I work for Rea and Associates as a Pen-Tester. 
- Who knows what a pen tester is ?

- Phishing - scam calls

## Engagements
Some engagements are easy and some not so much. 
- One was an external pentest of a website with bill pay. 
	Through a dirbuster scan I found a wordpress login page exposed to the internet.
	While booting my password cracking software, I tried admin/admin, and that logged me in.
	I had access for a week no one booted me off the website, even while logging in and out multiple times. One of the times it asked me to confirm my contact email, which I could have changed. 
	Also, with admin access to the wordpress site, I could have pointed the bill pay address to spoofed website and redirected payments. 
- Another time it was an all html website with a db that was meant to be open to the internet. I was diving through piles of CVE's hoping one was unpatched. a week later I still did not have access.
