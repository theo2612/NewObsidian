3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
	- Actions needed to prevent the incident from spreading
	- Securing the network from the attack
	- Isolating the infected host

4. Post-incident Activity / Lessons Learnt
	- identifying the loopholes in the security posture that led to the intrusion
	- Improving so that the attack does not happen again 
	- Indetifying weaknessess that lead to the attack
	- Adding detection rules so that similar breach does not happen again
	- Training staff
