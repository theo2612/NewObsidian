Hello fellow leets and skids, Welcome to Painful IT  
I'm theo, just a dude learning CyberSecurity.  
Thank you for stopping by.  
I'm obviously not streaming right now  
If I were, you'd see me attempting all things InfoSec related  
CTFs, coding, networking, Certificate Studying... Painfully... Like this  
  
I say Painfully, because typically everything I'm working on is relatively new to me  
and learning these types of concepts is not easy, but I'll keep trying  
Also, my discord is in the info section. I post a lot of the tools I use on there.  
So pop in, stay a while, lurk if you want and let me know what you want to attempt and learn with me.

Hi, I'm Theo and Welcome to Painful IT. The most painful stream on Twitch for learning Cyber Security and hacking concepts. Painful for me because learning these concepts is hard and takes time. Painful for you because, well you are watching. Painful like this...
Sit back, enjoy the music, and the great community we are creating. I love chatting with chat. Also this is chill place, feel free to ask any question, no matter how simple and we'll do our best to help.
