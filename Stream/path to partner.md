Sorry for the ping @everyone First I want to thank you all for hanging out with me on stream and spreading Good Vibes and encouragement to me and to others improving themselves. We are building an amazing community that genuinely wants to help and motivate others no matter their skill level and that is awesome. Thank you!

That being said, I'm asking for your help. I want to take a run at Twitch partner. The threshold that I'm stuck on is 75 concurrent viewers, I average about 25, which I am truly grateful for. The channel has been climbing steadily and organically over the years which is amazing and wonderful. Thank you all again.

If you want to help me, Here is what I'm proposing. 
**Twitch views the following as viewer.**
- A muted video player on Twitch, or the browser tab, with live video is playing.
- Stream open playing live video in another tab, even if that tab is not in focus.
- On Mobile, If live audio is playing or if you have minimized the live stream in the background on mobile.

So, if you see me go live, Come and hang out. If you are busy and don't have time to watch simply pop open a tab and mute me. Don't feel the need to tell me you are lurking if you are busy. I get it. 

I'll do my best to maintain and commit to my schedule so you know when to expect me to streaming.
