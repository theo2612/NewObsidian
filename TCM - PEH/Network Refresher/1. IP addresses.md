**IP addresses are a Layer 3/Netweork protocol, Router**

*inet = IPv4 address -- in decimal notation
inet6 = IPv6 address -- hexadecimal notation*

*inet/IPv4 address*
	each section/octet/between the periods -- 1's and 0's is eight bits
	in total a IPv4 address is made up of 
	32bits = 8+8+8+8 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
	128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 = 255

*IPv4* Uses NAT / Network address translation
 	with NAT we assign private IP addresses
	
*Private IP addresses*

|Network Class | Network Numbers | Network Mask | No. of Networks | No of hosts per Network| INFO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Class A | 10.0.0.0 | 255.0.0.0 | 126 | 16,646,144 | 
| Class B | 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0 | 255.255.0.0 | 16383 | 65024 |
| Class C | 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 | 2,097,151 | 254| Most common for home and small business |
| LoopBack | 127.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.7 | 255.255.255.0 | --- | --- |

Class A - Most common for big business, Small number of networks, large number of hosts
Class B -
Class C - Most common for home and small business, Large number of networks, small number of hosts
Any IP address outside of these public IP's and loopback are private  IP's and up for grabs. most likely already grabbed
