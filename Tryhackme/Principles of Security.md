Confidentiality - the protection of data for unauthorized access and misuse  
examples - employee records, accounting documents  
  
Integrity - the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.  
Access control and rigorous authentication can help prevent authorized users from making unauthorized changes. Hash verifications and digital signatures can help ensure that transactions are authentic and that files have not been modified or corrupted.  
  
Availability - for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.
