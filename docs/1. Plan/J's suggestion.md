Assumptions: You have some IT background. 
You should be comfortable with bash and [[linux]]. 
Knowing some c isn't required, but would be helpful. 

**Day 0** Register for confluence cloud free. _using obsidian_ This is now your personal wiki. Document all new tools, all lab pwns, everything you find new goes here. 
Prof Messer Network + youtube videos, Sec+ too if you are a n00b. Don't worry about the certs. 
If you are a comp sci guy go read the non-crypto and hardware parts of Du's book [[[https]]://www.amazon.com/Computer-Internet-Security-Hands-Approach/dp/1733003924]([[https]]://www.amazon.com/Computer-Internet-Security-Hands-Approach/dp/1733003924) . Consider doing the SEED labs associated with it. If you aren't a comp sci person give it a try, but temper your expectations - this shit is wild. 

**Day 1** - I am a hacker newbie Start with INE Starter Pass for Penetration Testing Student (free) INE 

**Day 1337** Go through cyberstart game Discover your hidden talent for cyber security with over 200 challenges It is gamified, but will take you very far. Make sure to learn python in here (if you don't already know it) – that is key! 

**Day 1337++** Go for [[tryhackme]]'s offensive path. Skip the [[buffer overflow]] for now, but do everything else. If this is too challenging go to complete beginner path then return. If you aren't ready go to the cyber mentor and do the Practical Ethical Hacking Complete course. 

**Day 8080** You need to learn some webhacking. Go for portswigger academy, unless you have the resources to take GWAPT or eWAPT. You should know and be comfortable with [[burp]] intruder, proxy, intercepting, repeater. These are your go to! 

**Day 31337** You are almost there! Go to TCM academy and do both [[windows]] + [[linux]] privesc courses. Take notes! Practice using autorecon on the boxes you privesc. You will use this for pwk and [[oscp]]. 

**Day 65535** Do the shortest possible lab time for PWK (30 days). Ignore the pdf and videos. Ignore the [[buffer overflow]]. Go straight to the boxes. You should get about 1-2 boxes per night of effort. 3-4 on a full Saturday. With 15 days of straight effort (plan for it!). Aim for 50 boxes pwned in 30 days and you are in a good spot to pass. Do not go straight into the exam! Post PWK Pre-Exam Prep Do you know microsoft word really well? If not go learn it. You have 24 hours post lab to write a report. If you are young and new, this is a gap. Install greenshot, learn how it works and inverts colors etc. Practice saving the screenshots and pasting them into a document, etc. You will take many many screenshots. Go do as much of TJ Null's [[HTB]] list as you can stand. I did 90% of it. Review privesc. Review privesc. Review your weaknesses. Then review them again. Review the [[OSCP]] exam rules, the proctoring info, etc. Make checklists of what you need to submit, and how. Understand the rules really really well. SNAPSHOT your vm when it is in a good state. Trust me on this. My VM went borked right before the exam. I reverted to a working snapshot easily. Now go and do [[tryhackme]]'s [[buffer overflow]] room. This is all you need to do. Exam time Take the exam. Get some rest. Don't go into rabbit holes.
