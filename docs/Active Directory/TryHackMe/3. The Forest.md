# The Forest
A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an [[Active Directory]] network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:
* Trees - A hierarchy of domains in [[Active Directory]] Domain Services
* Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
* Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
* Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
* Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
* Domain Services - [[DNS]] Server, LLMNR, IPv6
* Domain Schema - Rules for object creation
