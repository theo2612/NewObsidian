### Digital Certificates and Keys - 1
*What is the Common name (CN) of the issuer of the SSL cert for https://cisa.gov ?*
below CN = DigiCert Global Root CA

```bash
openssl s_client -connectÂ [www.cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/):443 -showcerts

CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root CA
verify return:1
depth=1 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, CN = DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = District of Columbia, L = Washington, O = Department of Homeland Security, CN = www3.dhs.gov
verify return:1
```
flag: DigiCert Global Root CA

### Digital Certificates and Keys - 2

```
flag: 7a5c643bd504cebb9949eb714cebb302c833225c

### Digital Certificates & Keys - 3
*What is the name of the file that was **not** signed with one of these 4 certificates from the vendor?**
* download firmware updates and certificate
* save in linux /tmp - bottom left of file explorer
* use gpg linux sign tool to inspect Certificates and firmware updates
* Certificates

### Digital Certificates & Keys - 4
*Using the public key for [security@evergrandematerials.com](mailto:security@evergrandematerials.com) from the previous challenge, please encrypt a small text file containing the phrase "Decrypt Me" and send it to our verification server.
The encrypted file can be sent to our verification server via an application such as netcat: `nc challenges.icsjwgctf.com 8010 < encrypted_file`
If our verification server is able to successfully decrypt our file and it contains the magic phrase, it will respond back with the flag for this challenge.*

create a text file named DecryptMe
```bash
nano DecryptMe

"Decrypt Me"
```
Encrypt text file with gpg using public key for security@evergrandematerials.com. 
```bash
gpg -e -R A2E18432686FF524 DecryptMe.txt
gpg: B24A3925A00802AF: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user

sub  rsa3072/B24A3925A00802AF 2022-01-10 Ever Grande Materials <security@evergrandematerials.com>
 Primary key fingerprint: BA11 16A5 8288 EFA7 4319  AFB0 A2E1 8432 686F F524
      Subkey fingerprint: D464 0746 B083 A0A0 AA95  3A5C B24A 3925 A008 02AF

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.

Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
File 'DecryptMe.txt.gpg' exists. Overwrite? (y/N) y
