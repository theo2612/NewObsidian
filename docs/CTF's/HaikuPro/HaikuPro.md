# Pros
- recommended positions based on skills learned in ranges
- Skills resume
	- Top Commands
	- Top Skills
	- pdf resume - include with actual resume

# Cons
- no custom pfp?
- range play tutorial is all over the place
- logged me out in the middle of the range play tutorial
- Can't extend the timer?
- vm slow 
- Can't access intenet with firefox?
- How the hell do you paste?
- copy/paste is painful

After all tutorials are complete it defaults you to - Intro to Ethical Hacker

I prefer to work on ctf/ranges in my [[kali]] VM - interested to see how it runs without doing that
