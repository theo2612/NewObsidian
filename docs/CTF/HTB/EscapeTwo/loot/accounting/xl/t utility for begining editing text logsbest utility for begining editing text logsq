       This manual page is provided as a courtesy.  Please note that the One Source Of Truth for [4mgawk[24m is the Texinfo manual, available online in
       several  formats  at [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual[24m.  It may also be installed in the Info subsystem on your system, and avail‐
       able therefore via the [4minfo[24m(1) command.

       In the case of any contradiction between the Texinfo manual and this man page, the manual should be considered to be authoritative.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mGawk[24m is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of the  language  in  the  POSIX
       1003.1  standard.   This  version in turn is based on the description in [4mThe[24m [4mAWK[24m [4mProgramming[24m [4mLanguage[24m, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.
       [4mGawk[24m provides the additional features found in the current version of Brian Kernighan's [4mawk[24m and numerous GNU-specific extensions.

       The command line consists of options to [4mgawk[24m itself, the AWK program text (if not supplied via the [1m-f [22mor [1m--include [22moptions),  and  values
       to be made available in the [1mARGC [22mand [1mARGV [22mpre-defined AWK variables.

[1mPREFACE[0m
       This  manual  page  is  intentionally as terse as possible.  Full details are provided in [4mGAWK:[24m [4mEffective[24m [4mAWK[24m [4mProgramming[24m, and you should
       look there for the full story on any specific feature.  Where possible, links to the online version of the manual are provided.

[1mOPTION FORMAT[0m
       [4mGawk[24m options may be either traditional POSIX-style one letter options, or GNU-style long options.  POSIX options start with a single “-”,
       while long options start with “--”.  Long options are provided for both GNU-specific features and for POSIX-mandated features.

       [4mGawk[24m-specific options are typically used in long-option form.  Arguments to long options are either joined with the option by an [1m=  [22msign,
       with  no  intervening spaces, or they may be provided in the next command line argument.  Long options may be abbreviated, as long as the
       abbreviation remains unique.

       Additionally, every long option has a corresponding short option, so that the option's functionality may be  used  from  within  [1m#!  [22mexe‐
       cutable scripts.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [4mGawk[24m accepts the following options.  Standard options are listed first, followed by options for [4mgawk[24m extensions, listed alphabetically by
       short option.

       [1m-f [4m[22mprogram-file[24m, [1m--file [4m[22mprogram-file[0m
              Read  the AWK program source from the file [4mprogram-file[24m, instead of from the first command line argument.  Multiple [1m-f [22moptions may
              be used.  Files read with [1m-f [22mare treated as if they begin with an implicit [1m@namespace "awk" [22mstatement.

       [1m-F [4m[22mfs[24m, [1m--field-separator [4m[22mfs[0m
              Use [4mfs[24m for the input field separator (the value of the [1mFS [22mpredefined variable).

       [1m-v [4m[22mvar[24m[1m=[4m[22mval[24m, [1m--assign [4m[22mvar[24m[1m=[4m[22mval[0m
              Assign the value [4mval[24m to the variable [4mvar[24m, before execution of the program begins.  Such variable values are available to the [1mBEGIN[0m
              rule of an AWK program.

       [1m-b[22m, [1m--characters-as-bytes[0m
              Treat all input data as single-byte characters.  The [1m--posix [22moption overrides this one.

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--traditional[0m
              Run in [4mcompatibility[24m mode.  In compatibility mode, [4mgawk[24m behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's [4mawk[24m; none of the GNU-specific ex‐
              tensions are recognized.

       [1m-C[22m, [1m--copyright[0m
              Print the short version of the GNU copyright information message on the standard output and exit successfully.

       [1m-d[22m[[4mfile[24m], [1m--dump-variables[22m[[1m=[4m[22mfile[24m]
              Print a sorted list of global variables, their types and final values to [4mfile[24m.  The default file is [1mawkvars.out [22min the current di‐
              rectory.

       [1m-D[22m[[4mfile[24m], [1m--debug[22m[[1m=[4m[22mfile[24m]
              Enable debugging of AWK programs.  By default, the debugger reads commands interactively from the keyboard (standard input).   The
              optional [4mfile[24m argument specifies a file with a list of commands for the debugger to execute non-interactively.
              In  this  mode of execution, [4mgawk[24m loads the AWK source code and then prompts for debugging commands.  [4mGawk[24m can only debug AWK pro‐
              gram source provided with the [1m-f [22mand [1m--include [22moptions.  The debugger is  documented  in  [4mGAWK:[24m  [4mEffective[24m  [4mAWK[24m  [4mProgramming[24m;  see
              [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Debugger.html#Debugger[24m.

       [1m-e [4m[22mprogram-text[24m, [1m--source [4m[22mprogram-text[0m
              Use [4mprogram-text[24m as AWK program source code.  Each argument supplied via [1m-e [22mis treated as if it begins with an implicit [1m@namespace[0m
              [1m"awk" [22mstatement.

       [1m-E [4m[22mfile[24m, [1m--exec [4m[22mfile[0m
              Similar to [1m-f[22m, however, this option is the last one processed.  This should be used with [1m#! [22mscripts, particularly for CGI applica‐
              tions,  to avoid passing in options or source code (!) on the command line from a URL.  This option disables command-line variable
              assignments.

       [1m-g[22m, [1m--gen-pot[0m
              Scan and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU [1m.pot [22m(Portable Object Template) format file on standard output with entries for
              all localizable strings in the program.  The program itself is not executed.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--help[0m
              Print a relatively short summary of the available options on the standard output.  Per the [4mGNU[24m  [4mCoding[24m  [4mStandards[24m,  these  options
              cause an immediate, successful exit.

       [1m-i [4m[22minclude-file[24m, [1m--include [4m[22minclude-file[0m
              Load  an  awk source library.  This searches for the library using the [1mAWKPATH [22menvironment variable.  If the initial search fails,
              another attempt will be made after appending the [1m.awk [22msuffix.  The file will be loaded only  once  (i.e.,  duplicates  are  elimi‐
              nated),  and the code does not constitute the main program source.  Files read with [1m--include [22mare treated as if they begin with an
              implicit [1m@namespace "awk" [22mstatement.

       [1m-I[22m, [1m--trace[0m
              Print the internal byte code names as they are executed when running the program.  The trace is printed to standard  error.   Each
              “op code” is preceded by a [1m+ [22msign in the output.

       [1m-k[22m, [1m--csv[0m
              Enable CSV special processing.  See [1mComma Separated Values[22m, below, for more detail.

       [1m-l [4m[22mlib[24m, [1m--load [4m[22mlib[0m
              Load  a  [4mgawk[24m extension from the shared library [4mlib[24m.  This searches for the library using the [1mAWKLIBPATH [22menvironment variable.  If
              the initial search fails, another attempt will be made after appending the default shared library suffix for  the  platform.   The
              library initialization routine is expected to be named [1mdl_load()[22m.

       [1m-L [22m[[4mvalue[24m], [1m--lint[22m[[1m=[4m[22mvalue[24m]
              Provide  warnings  about  constructs that are dubious or non-portable to other AWK implementations.  See [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/soft‐[0m
              [4mware/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html#Options[24m for the list of possible values for [4mvalue[24m.

       [1m-M[22m, [1m--bignum[0m
              Force arbitrary precision arithmetic on numbers.  This option has no effect if [4mgawk[24m is not compiled to use the GNU  MPFR  and  GMP
              libraries.  (In such a case, [4mgawk[24m issues a warning.)

              [1mNOTE: [22mThis feature is [4mon[24m [4mparole[24m.  The primary [4mgawk[24m maintainer is no longer supporting it, although there is a member of the devel‐
              opment team who is.  If this situation changes, the feature will be removed from [4mgawk[24m.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--non-decimal-data[0m

       [1m-N[22m, [1m--use-lc-numeric[0m
              Force [4mgawk[24m to use the locale's decimal point character when parsing input data.

       [1m-o[22m[[4mfile[24m], [1m--pretty-print[22m[[1m=[4m[22mfile[24m]
              Output  a  pretty  printed version of the program to [4mfile[24m.  The default file is [1mawkprof.out [22min the current directory.  This option
              implies [1m--no-optimize[22m.

       [1m-O[22m, [1m--optimize[0m
              Enable [4mgawk[24m's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.  This option is on by default.

       [1m-p[22m[[4mprof-file[24m], [1m--profile[22m[[1m=[4m[22mprof-file[24m]
              Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to [4mprof-file[24m.  The default is [1mawkprof.out [22min the  current  directory.   The
              profile  contains  execution counts of each statement in the program in the left margin and function call counts for each user-de‐
              fined function.  [4mGawk[24m runs more slowly in this mode.  This option implies [1m--no-optimize[22m.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--posix[0m
              This turns on [4mcompatibility[24m mode, and disables a number of common extensions.

       [1m-r[22m, [1m--re-interval[0m
              Enable the use of [4minterval[24m [4mexpressions[24m in regular expression matching.  Interval expressions are enabled by default, but this  op‐
              tion remains for backwards compatibility.

       [1m-s[22m, [1m--no-optimize[0m
              Disable [4mgawk[24m's default optimizations upon the internal representation of the program.

       [1m-S[22m, [1m--sandbox[0m
              Run  [4mgawk[24m  in  sandbox  mode,  disabling  the [1msystem() [22mfunction, input redirection with [1mgetline[22m, output redirection with [1mprint [22mand
              [1mprintf[22m, and loading dynamic extensions.  Command execution (through pipelines) is also disabled.

       [1m-t[22m, [1m--lint-old[0m
              Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to the original version of UNIX [4mawk[24m.

       [1m-V[22m, [1m--version[0m
              Print version information for this particular copy of [4mgawk[24m on the standard output.  This is useful when reporting bugs.   Per  the
              [4mGNU[24m [4mCoding[24m [4mStandards[24m, these options cause an immediate, successful exit.

       [1m--     [22mSignal the end of options.  This is useful to allow further arguments to the AWK program itself to start with a “-”.

       In compatibility mode, any other options are flagged as invalid, but are otherwise ignored.  In normal operation, as long as program text
       has been supplied, unknown options are passed on to the AWK program in the [1mARGV [22marray for processing.

       For POSIX compatibility, the [1m-W [22moption may be used, followed by the name of a long option.

[1mAWK PROGRAM EXECUTION[0m
       An AWK program consists of a sequence of optional directives, pattern-action statements, and optional function definitions.

              [1m@include "[4m[22mfilename[24m[1m"[0m
              [1m@load "[4m[22mfilename[24m[1m"[0m
              [1m@namespace "[4m[22mname[24m[1m"[0m
              [4mpattern[24m   [1m{ [4m[22maction[24m [4mstatements[24m [1m}[0m
              [1mfunction [4m[22mname[24m[1m([4m[22mparameter[24m [4mlist[24m[1m) { [4m[22mstatements[24m [1m}[0m

       [4mGawk[24m first reads the program source from the [4mprogram-file[24m(s) if specified, from arguments to [1m--source[22m, or from the first non-option argu‐
       ment on the command line.  The [1m-f [22mand [1m--source [22moptions may be used multiple times on the command line.  [4mGawk[24m reads the program text as if
       all the [4mprogram-file[24ms and command line source texts had been concatenated together.

       In  addition, lines beginning with [1m@include [22mmay be used to include other source files into your program.  This is equivalent to using the
       [1m--include [22moption.

       Lines beginning with [1m@load [22mmay be used to load extension functions into your program.  This is equivalent to using the [1m--load [22moption.

       The environment variable [1mAWKPATH [22mspecifies a search path to use when finding source files named with the [1m-f [22mand  [1m--include  [22moptions.   If
       this  variable does not exist, the default path is [1m".:/usr/local/share/awk"[22m.  (The actual directory may vary, depending upon how [4mgawk[24m was
       built and installed.)  If a file name given to the [1m-f [22moption contains a “/” character, no path search is performed.

       The environment variable [1mAWKLIBPATH [22mspecifies a search path to use when finding source files named with the [1m--load [22moption.  If this vari‐
       able does not exist, the default path is [1m"/usr/local/lib/gawk"[22m.  (The actual directory may vary, depending upon how [4mgawk[24m  was  built  and
       installed.)

       [4mGawk[24m  executes  AWK  programs  in the following order.  First, all variable assignments specified via the [1m-v [22moption are performed.  Next,
       [4mgawk[24m compiles the program into an internal form.  Then, [4mgawk[24m executes the code in the [1mBEGIN [22mrule(s) (if any), and then proceeds  to  read
       each file named in the [1mARGV [22marray (up to [1mARGV[ARGC-1][22m).  If there are no files named on the command line, [4mgawk[24m reads the standard input.

       If  a  filename  on  the command line has the form [4mvar[24m[1m=[4m[22mval[24m it is treated as a variable assignment.  The variable [4mvar[24m will be assigned the
       value [4mval[24m.  (This happens after any [1mBEGIN [22mrule(s) have been run.)

       If the value of a particular element of [1mARGV [22mis empty ([1m""[22m), [4mgawk[24m skips over it.

       For each input file, if a [1mBEGINFILE [22mrule exists, [4mgawk[24m executes the associated code before processing the contents  of  the  file.   Simi‐
       larly, [4mgawk[24m executes the code associated with [1mENDFILE [22mrules after processing the file.

       For  each record in the input, [4mgawk[24m tests to see if it matches any [4mpattern[24m in the AWK program.  For each pattern that the record matches,
       [4mgawk[24m executes the associated [4maction[24m.  The patterns are tested in the order they occur in the program.

       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, [4mgawk[24m executes the code in the [1mEND [22mrule(s) (if any).

   [1mCommand Line Directories[0m
       According to POSIX, files named on the [4mawk[24m command line must be text files.  The behavior is “undefined” if they are not.  Most  versions
       of [4mawk[24m treat a directory on the command line as a fatal error.

       For  [4mgawk[24m,  a  directory on the command line produces a warning, but is otherwise skipped.  If either of the [1m--posix [22mor [1m--traditional [22mop‐
       tions is given, then [4mgawk[24m reverts to treating directories on the command line as a fatal error.

[1mVARIABLES, RECORDS AND FIELDS[0m
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are first used.  Their values are either floating-point numbers or strings,
       or both, depending upon how they are used.  Additionally, [4mgawk[24m allows variables to have regular-expression type.  AWK also has one dimen‐
       sional arrays; arrays with multiple dimensions may be simulated.  However, [4mgawk[24m provides true  arrays  of  arrays.   Several  pre-defined
       variables are set as a program runs; these are described as needed and summarized below.

   [1mRecords[0m
       Normally,  records  are  separated  by newline characters.  You can control how records are separated by assigning values to the built-in
       variable [1mRS[22m.  See [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html[24m for the details.

   [1mFields[0m
       As each input record is read, [4mgawk[24m splits the record into [4mfields[24m, using the value of the [1mFS [22mvariable as the field  separator.   Addition‐
       ally,  [1mFIELDWIDTHS  [22mand  [1mFPAT  [22mmay  be  used  to  control  input field splitting.  See the details, starting at [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/soft‐[0m
       [4mware/gawk/manual/html_node/Fields.html[24m.

       Each field in the input record may be referenced by its position: [1m$1[22m, [1m$2[22m, and so on.  [1m$0 [22mis  the  whole  record,  including  leading  and
       trailing whitespace.

       The variable [1mNF [22mis set to the total number of fields in the input record.

       References  to  non-existent  fields (i.e., fields after [1m$NF[22m) produce the null string.  However, assigning to a non-existent field (e.g.,
       [1m$(NF+2) = 5[22m) increases the value of [1mNF[22m, creates any intervening fields with the null string as their values, and causes the value  of  [1m$0[0m
       to  be  recomputed,  with  the  fields  being separated by the value of [1mOFS[22m.  References to negative numbered fields cause a fatal error.
       Decrementing [1mNF [22mcauses the values of fields past the new value to be lost, and the value of [1m$0 [22mto be recomputed, with  the  fields  being
       separated by the value of [1mOFS[22m.

       Assigning  a  value to an existing field causes the whole record to be rebuilt when [1m$0 [22mis referenced.  Similarly, assigning a value to [1m$0[0m
       causes the record to be resplit, creating new values for the fields.

   [1mComma Separated Values[0m
       When invoked with either the [1m-k [22mor the [1m--csv [22moption, [4mgawk[24m does not use regular record determination  and  field  splitting  as  described
       above.   Instead,  records are terminated by unquoted newlines, and fields are separated by commas.  Double-quotes may be used to enclose
       fields containing commas, newlines, or doubled  double-quotes.   See  [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Comma-Separated-[0m

                   the [1mdelete [22mstatement with the [1mSYMTAB [22marray, nor assign to elements with an index that is not a variable name.

       [1mTEXTDOMAIN  [22mThe text domain of the AWK program; used to find the localized translations for the program's strings.

   [1mArrays[0m
       Arrays  are  subscripted  with an expression between square brackets ([1m[ [22mand [1m][22m).  If the expression is an expression list ([4mexpr[24m, [4mexpr[24m ...)
       then the array subscript is a string consisting of the concatenation of the (string) value of each expression, separated by the value  of
       the [1mSUBSEP [22mvariable.  This facility is used to simulate multiply dimensioned arrays.  For example:

              [1mi = "A"; j = "B"; k = "C"[0m
              [1mx[i, j, k] = "hello, world\n"[0m

       assigns  the  string  [1m"hello, world\n" [22mto the element of the array [1mx [22mwhich is indexed by the string [1m"A\034B\034C"[22m.  All arrays in AWK are
       associative, i.e., indexed by string values.

       The special operator [1min [22mmay be used to test if an array has an index consisting of a particular value:

              [1mif (val in array)[0m
                   [1mprint array[val][0m

       If the array has multiple subscripts, use [1m(i, j) in array[22m.

       The [1min [22mconstruct may also be used in a [1mfor [22mloop to iterate over all the elements of an array.  However, the [1m(i,  j)  in  array  [22mconstruct
       only works in tests, not in [1mfor [22mloops.

       An  element may be deleted from an array using the [1mdelete [22mstatement.  The [1mdelete [22mstatement may also be used to delete the entire contents
       of an array, just by specifying the array name without a subscript.

       [4mgawk[24m supports  true  multidimensional  arrays.   It  does  not  require  that  such  arrays  be  “rectangular”  as  in  C  or  C++.   See
       [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arrays[24m for details.

   [1mNamespaces[0m
       [4mGawk[24m provides a simple [4mnamespace[24m facility to help work around the fact that all variables in AWK are global.

       A  [4mqualified[24m  [4mname[24m consists of a two simple identifiers joined by a double colon ([1m::[22m).  The left-hand identifier represents the namespace
       and the right-hand identifier is the variable within it.  All simple (non-qualified) names are considered to be in  the  “current”  name‐
       space;  the  default  namespace is [1mawk[22m.  However, simple identifiers consisting solely of uppercase letters are forced into the [1mawk [22mname‐
       space, even if the current namespace is different.

       You change the current namespace with an [1m@namespace "[4m[22mname[24m[1m" [22mdirective.

       The standard predefined builtin function names may not be used as namespace names.  The names of additional functions  provided  by  [4mgawk[0m
       may  be  used  as  namespace  names  or  as  simple  identifiers  in  other  namespaces.  For more details, see [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/soft‐[0m
       [4mware/gawk/manual/html_node/Namespaces.html#Namespaces[24m.

   [1mVariable Typing And Conversion[0m
       Variables and fields may be (floating point) numbers, or strings, or both.  They may also be regular expressions.  How  the  value  of  a
       variable  is  interpreted depends upon its context.  If used in a numeric expression, it will be treated as a number; if used as a string
       it will be treated as a string.

       To force a variable to be treated as a number, add zero to it; to force it to be treated as  a  string,  concatenate  it  with  the  null
       string.

       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value zero and the string value "" (the null, or empty, string).

       When  a string must be converted to a number, the conversion is accomplished using [4mstrtod[24m(3).  A number is converted to a string by using
       the value of [1mCONVFMT [22mas a format string for [4msprintf[24m(3), with the numeric value of the variable as the argument.  However, even though all
       numbers in AWK are floating-point, integral values are [4malways[24m converted as integers.

       [4mGawk[24m performs comparisons as follows: If two variables are numeric, they are compared numerically.  If one value is numeric and the other
       has a string value that is a “numeric string,” then comparisons are also done numerically.  Otherwise, the numeric value is converted  to
       a string and a string comparison is performed.  Two strings are compared, of course, as strings.

       Note  that string constants, such as [1m"57"[22m, are [4mnot[24m numeric strings, they are string constants.  The idea of “numeric string” only applies
       to fields, [1mgetline [22minput, [1mFILENAME[22m, [1mARGV [22melements, [1mENVIRON [22melements and the elements of an array created by [1msplit()  [22mor  [1mpatsplit()  [22mthat
       are numeric strings.  The basic idea is that [4muser[24m [4minput[24m, and only user input, that looks numeric, should be treated that way.

   [1mOctal and Hexadecimal Constants[0m
       You  may use C-style octal and hexadecimal constants in your AWK program source code.  For example, the octal value [1m011 [22mis equal to deci‐
       mal [1m9[22m, and the hexadecimal value [1m0x11 [22mis equal to decimal 17.

   [1mString Constants[0m
       String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed between double quotes (like [1m"value"[22m).  Within strings,  certain  [4mescape[24m  [4mse‐[0m
       [4mquences[24m are recognized, as in C.  See [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-Sequences[24m for the details.

   [1mRegexp Constants[0m
       A regular expression constant is a sequence of characters enclosed between forward slashes (like [1m/value/[22m).

       The  escape  sequences described in the manual may also be used inside constant regular expressions (e.g., [1m/[ \t\f\n\r\v]/ [22mmatches white‐
       space characters).

       [4mGawk[24m provides [4mstrongly[24m [4mtyped[24m regular expression constants.  These are written with a leading [1m@ [22msymbol (like  so:  [1m@/value/[22m).   Such  con‐
       stants may be assigned to scalars (variables, array elements) and passed to user-defined functions.  Variables that have been so assigned
       have regular expression type.

[1mPATTERNS AND ACTIONS[0m
       AWK  is  a line-oriented language.  The pattern comes first, and then the action.  Action statements are enclosed in [1m{ [22mand [1m}[22m.  Either the
       pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing, but, of course, not both.  If the pattern is missing, the action executes for every
       single record of input.  A missing action is equivalent to

              [1m{ print }[0m

       which prints the entire record.

       Comments begin with the [1m# [22mcharacter, and continue until the end of the line.  Empty lines may be used to separate statements.   Normally,
       a  statement  ends  with a newline, however, this is not the case for lines ending in a comma, [1m{[22m, [1m?[22m, [1m:[22m, [1m&&[22m, or [1m||[22m.  Lines ending in [1mdo [22mor
       [1melse [22malso have their statements automatically continued on the following line.  In other cases, a line can be continued by ending it with
       a “\”, in which case the newline is ignored.  However, a “\” after a [1m# [22mis not special.

       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them with a “;”.  This applies to both the statements within the action part  of
       a pattern-action pair (the usual case), and to the pattern-action statements themselves.

   [1mPatterns[0m
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:

              [1mBEGIN[0m
              [1mEND[0m
              [1mBEGINFILE[0m
              [1mENDFILE[0m
              [1m/[4m[22mregular[24m [4mexpression[24m[1m/[0m
              [4mrelational[24m [4mexpression[0m
              [4mpattern[24m [1m&& [4m[22mpattern[0m
              [4mpattern[24m [1m|| [4m[22mpattern[0m
              [4mpattern[24m [1m? [4m[22mpattern[24m [1m: [4m[22mpattern[0m
              [1m([4m[22mpattern[24m[1m)[0m
              [1m! [4m[22mpattern[0m
              [4mpattern1[24m[1m, [4m[22mpattern2[0m

       [1mBEGIN  [22mand  [1mEND  [22mare  two  special  kinds of patterns which are not tested against the input.  The action parts of all [1mBEGIN [22mpatterns are
       merged as if all the statements had been written in a single [1mBEGIN [22mrule.  They are executed before any of the input is read.   Similarly,
       all  the  [1mEND [22mrules are merged, and executed when all the input is exhausted (or when an [1mexit [22mstatement is executed).  [1mBEGIN [22mand [1mEND [22mpat‐
       terns cannot be combined with other patterns in pattern expressions.  [1mBEGIN [22mand [1mEND [22mpatterns cannot have missing action parts.

       [1mBEGINFILE [22mand [1mENDFILE [22mare additional special patterns whose actions are executed before reading the first record of each command-line in‐
       put file and after reading the last record of each file.  Inside the [1mBEGINFILE [22mrule, the value of [1mERRNO [22mis the empty string if  the  file
       was  opened  successfully.   Otherwise,  there is some problem with the file and the code should use [1mnextfile [22mto skip it.  If that is not
       done, [4mgawk[24m produces its usual fatal error for files that cannot be opened.

       For [1m/[4m[22mregular[24m [4mexpression[24m[1m/ [22mpatterns, the associated statement is executed for each input record that matches the regular expression.  Regu‐
       lar expressions are essentially the same as those in [4megrep[24m(1).   See  [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Regexp.html[24m  for
       the details on regular expressions.

       A  [4mrelational[24m  [4mexpression[24m  may  use  any  of the operators defined below in the section on actions.  These generally test whether certain
       fields match certain regular expressions.

       The [1m&&[22m, [1m||[22m, and [1m!  [22moperators are logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT, respectively, as in C.  They do short-circuit evaluation, also
       as in C, and are used for combining more primitive pattern expressions.  As in most languages, parentheses may be used to change the  or‐
       der of evaluation.

       The  [1m?:  [22moperator  is like the same operator in C.  If the first pattern is true then the pattern used for testing is the second pattern,
       otherwise it is the third.  Only one of the second and third patterns is evaluated.

       The [4mpattern1[24m[1m, [4m[22mpattern2[24m form of an expression is called a [4mrange[24m [4mpattern[24m.  It matches all input records starting with a record that matches
       [4mpattern1[24m, and continuing until a record that matches [4mpattern2[24m, inclusive.  It does not combine with any other sort of pattern expression.

   [1mActions[0m
       Action statements are enclosed in braces, [1m{ [22mand [1m}[22m.  Action statements consist of the usual assignment, conditional,  and  looping  state‐
       ments found in most languages.  The operators, control statements, and input/output statements available are patterned after those in C.

   [1mOperators[0m
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence, are:

       [1m([22m...[1m)       [22mGrouping

       [1m$           [22mField reference.

   [1mSpecial File Names[0m
       When doing I/O redirection from either [1mprint [22mor [1mprintf [22minto a file, or via [1mgetline [22mfrom a file, [4mgawk[24m recognizes certain special filenames
       internally.   These filenames allow access to open file descriptors inherited from [4mgawk[24m's parent process (usually the shell).  These file
       names may also be used on the command line to name data files.  The filenames are:

       [1m-           [22mThe standard input.

       [1m/dev/stdin  [22mThe standard input.

       [1m/dev/stdout [22mThe standard output.

       [1m/dev/stderr [22mThe standard error output.

       [1m/dev/fd/[4m[22mn[24m   The file associated with the open file descriptor [4mn[24m.

       The following special filenames may be used with the [1m|& [22mcoprocess operator for creating TCP/IP network connections:

       [4mGawk[24m is multibyte aware.  This means that [1mindex()[22m, [1mlength()[22m, [1msubstr() [22mand [1mmatch() [22mall work in terms of characters, not bytes.

   [1mTime Functions[0m
       [4mGawk[24m  provides  the following functions for obtaining time stamps and formatting them.  Details are provided in [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/soft‐[0m
       [4mware/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions[24m.

                 Turn [4mdatespec[24m into a time stamp of the same form as returned by [1msystime()[22m, and return the result.  If [4mutc-flag[24m is  present  and
                 is non-zero or non-null, the time is assumed to be in the UTC time zone; otherwise, the time is assumed to be in the local time
                 zone.   If  [4mdatespec[24m  does  not  contain  enough  elements  or if the resulting time is out of range, [1mmktime() [22mreturns -1.  See
                 [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions.html#Time-Functions[24m for the details of [4mdatespec[24m.

                 Format [4mtimestamp[24m according to the specification in [4mformat[24m.  If [4mutc-flag[24m is present and is non-zero or non-null, the  result  is
                 in  UTC,  otherwise  the result is in local time.  The [4mtimestamp[24m should be of the same form as returned by [1msystime()[22m.  If [4mtime‐[0m
                 [4mstamp[24m is missing, the current time of day is used.  If [4mformat[24m is missing, a default format equivalent to the output of  [4mdate[24m(1)
                 is  used.  The default format is available in [1mPROCINFO["strftime"][22m.  See the specification for the [1mstrftime() [22mfunction in ISO C
                 for the format conversions that are guaranteed to be available.

       [1msystime() [22mReturn the current time of day as the number of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX systems).

   [1mBit Manipulations Functions[0m
       [4mGawk[24m supplies the following bit manipulation functions.  They work by converting double-precision floating point values to [1muintmax_t  [22min‐
       tegers,  doing the operation, and then converting the result back to floating point.  Passing negative operands to any of these functions
       causes a fatal error.

       The functions are:

       [1mand([4m[22mv1[24m[1m, [4m[22mv2[24m [, ...][1m) [22mReturn the bitwise AND of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at least two.

       [1mcompl([4m[22mval[24m[1m)          [22mReturn the bitwise complement of [4mval[24m.

       [1mlshift([4m[22mval[24m[1m, [4m[22mcount[24m[1m)  [22mReturn the value of [4mval[24m, shifted left by [4mcount[24m bits.

       [1mor([4m[22mv1[24m[1m, [4m[22mv2[24m [, ...][1m)  [22mReturn the bitwise OR of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at least two.

       [1mrshift([4m[22mval[24m[1m, [4m[22mcount[24m[1m)  [22mReturn the value of [4mval[24m, shifted right by [4mcount[24m bits.

       [1mxor([4m[22mv1[24m[1m, [4m[22mv2[24m [, ...][1m) [22mReturn the bitwise XOR of the values provided in the argument list.  There must be at least two.

   [1mType Functions[0m
       The following functions provide type related information about their arguments.

       [1misarray([4m[22mx[24m[1m) [22mReturn true if [4mx[24m is an array, false otherwise.

       [1mtypeof([4m[22mx[24m[1m)  [22mReturn a string indicating the type of [4mx[24m.  The string will be one of [1m"array"[22m, [1m"number"[22m, [1m"regexp"[22m, [1m"string"[22m,  [1m"strnum"[22m,  [1m"unas‐[0m

   [1mInternationalization Functions[0m
       The  following  functions  may  be  used  from  within  your  AWK  program  for  translating  strings at run-time.  For full details, see
       [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I18N-Functions.html#I18N-Functions[24m.

       [1mbindtextdomain([4m[22mdirectory[24m [[1m, [4m[22mdomain[24m][1m)[0m
              Specify the directory where [4mgawk[24m looks for the [1m.gmo [22mfiles, in case they will not or cannot be placed in the “standard”  locations.
              It returns the directory where [4mdomain[24m is “bound.”
              The  default  [4mdomain[24m  is the value of [1mTEXTDOMAIN[22m.  If [4mdirectory[24m is the null string ([1m""[22m), then [1mbindtextdomain() [22mreturns the current
              binding for the given [4mdomain[24m.

       [1mdcgettext([4m[22mstring[24m [[1m, [4m[22mdomain[24m [[1m, [4m[22mcategory[24m]][1m)[0m
              Return the translation of [4mstring[24m in text domain [4mdomain[24m for locale category [4mcategory[24m.  The default value for [4mdomain[24m is the  current
              value of [1mTEXTDOMAIN[22m.  The default value for [4mcategory[24m is [1m"LC_MESSAGES"[22m.

              [4mgory[24m.  The default value for [4mdomain[24m is the current value of [1mTEXTDOMAIN[22m.  The default value for [4mcategory[24m is [1m"LC_MESSAGES"[22m.

   [1mBoolean Valued Functions[0m
       You can create special Boolean-typed values; see the manual for how they work and why they exist.

       [1mmkbool([4m[22mexpression[24m[1m)[0m
              Based on the boolean value of [4mexpression[24m return either a true value or a false value.  True values have numeric value one.   False
              values have numeric value zero.

[1mUSER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS[0m
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              [1mfunction [4m[22mname[24m[1m([4m[22mparameter[24m [4mlist[24m[1m) { [4m[22mstatements[24m [1m}[0m

       Functions execute when they are called from within expressions in either patterns or actions.  Actual parameters supplied in the function
       call  are used to instantiate the formal parameters declared in the function.  Arrays are passed by reference, other variables are passed
       by value.

       Local variables are declared as extra parameters in the parameter list.  The convention is to separate local variables from real  parame‐
       ters by extra spaces in the parameter list.  For example:

              [1mfunction  f(p, q,     a, b)   # a and b are local[0m
              [1m{[0m
                   [1m...[0m
              [1m}[0m

              [1m/abc/     { ... ; f(1, 2) ; ... }[0m

       The  left  parenthesis  in a function call is required to immediately follow the function name, without any intervening whitespace.  This
       restriction does not apply to the built-in functions listed above.

       Functions may call each other and may be recursive.  Function parameters used as local variables are initialized to the null  string  and
       the number zero upon function invocation.

       Use  [1mreturn [4m[22mexpr[24m to return a value from a function.  The return value is undefined if no value is provided, or if the function returns by
       “falling off” the end.

       Functions may be called indirectly.  To do this, assign the name of the function to be called, as a string, to a variable.  Then use  the
       variable as if it were the name of a function, prefixed with an [1m@ [22msign, like so:
              [1mfunction myfunc()[0m
              [1m{[0m
                   [1mprint "myfunc called"[0m
                   [1m...[0m
              [1m}[0m

              [1m{    ...[0m
                   [1mthe_func = "myfunc"[0m
                   [1m@the_func()    # call through the_func to myfunc[0m
                   [1m...[0m
              [1m}[0m

       If  [1m--lint  [22mhas been provided, [4mgawk[24m warns about calls to undefined functions at parse time, instead of at run time.  Calling an undefined
       function at run time is a fatal error.

[1mDYNAMICALLY LOADING NEW FUNCTIONS[0m
       You can dynamically add new functions written in C or C++ to the running [4mgawk[24m interpreter with the [1m@load [22mstatement.  The full details are
       beyond the scope of this manual page; see [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Dynamic-Extensions.html#Dynamic-Extensions[24m.

[1mSIGNALS[0m
       The [4mgawk[24m profiler accepts two signals.  [1mSIGUSR1 [22mcauses it to dump a profile and function call stack to the profile file, which is  either
       [1mawkprof.out[22m, or whatever file was named with the [1m--profile [22moption.  It then continues to run.  [1mSIGHUP [22mcauses [4mgawk[24m to dump the profile and
       function call stack and then exit.

[1mINTERNATIONALIZATION[0m
       String  constants  are  sequences  of characters enclosed in double quotes.  In non-English speaking environments, it is possible to mark
       strings in the AWK program as requiring translation to the local natural language.  Such strings are marked in the  AWK  program  with  a
       leading underscore (“_”).  For example,

              [1mgawk 'BEGIN { print "hello, world" }'[0m

       always prints [1mhello, world[22m.  But,

              [1mgawk 'BEGIN { print _"hello, world" }'[0m

       might print [1mbonjour, monde [22min France.  See [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Internationalization.html#Internationaliza‐[0m
       [4mtion[24m for the steps involved in producing and running a localizable AWK program.

[1mGNU EXTENSIONS[0m
       [4mGawk[24m   has   a   too-large   number   of   extensions  to  POSIX  [4mawk[24m.   They  are  described  in  [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/man‐[0m
       [4mual/html_node/POSIX_002fGNU.html[24m.  All the extensions can be disabled by invoking [4mgawk[24m with the [1m--traditional [22mor [1m--posix [22moptions.

[1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       The [1mAWKPATH [22menvironment variable can be used to provide a list of directories that [4mgawk[24m searches when looking for files named via the [1m-f[22m,
       [1m--file[22m, [1m-i [22mand [1m--include [22moptions, and the [1m@include [22mdirective.  If the initial search fails, the path is searched  again  after  appending
       [1m.awk [22mto the filename.

       The  [1mAWKLIBPATH [22menvironment variable can be used to provide a list of directories that [4mgawk[24m searches when looking for files named via the
       [1m-l [22mand [1m--load [22moptions.

       The [1mGAWK_PERSIST_FILE [22menvironment variable, if present, specifies a file to use as the backing store for persistent  memory.   See  [4mGAWK:[0m
       [4mEffective[24m [4mAWK[24m [4mProgramming[24m for the details.

       The  [1mGAWK_READ_TIMEOUT  [22menvironment  variable can be used to specify a timeout in milliseconds for reading input from a terminal, pipe or
       two-way communication including sockets.

       For connection to a remote host via socket, [1mGAWK_SOCK_RETRIES [22mcontrols the number of retries, and [1mGAWK_MSEC_SLEEP  [22mthe  interval  between
       retries.   The  interval  is in milliseconds.  On systems that do not support [4musleep[24m(3), the value is rounded up to an integral number of
       seconds.

       If [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT [22mexists in the environment, then [4mgawk[24m behaves exactly as if [1m--posix [22mhad been specified on the command line.  If  [1m--lint[0m
       has been specified, [4mgawk[24m issues a warning message to this effect.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       If the [1mexit [22mstatement is used with a value, then [4mgawk[24m exits with the numeric value given to it.

       Otherwise, if there were no problems during execution, [4mgawk[24m exits with the value of the C constant [1mEXIT_SUCCESS[22m.  This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, [4mgawk[24m exits with the value of the C constant [1mEXIT_FAILURE[22m.  This is usually one.

       If [4mgawk[24m exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2.  On non-POSIX systems, this value may be mapped to [1mEXIT_FAILURE[22m.

[1mVERSION INFORMATION[0m
       This man page documents [4mgawk[24m, version 5.3.

[1mAUTHORS[0m
       The  original version of UNIX [4mawk[24m was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.
       Ozan Yigit is the current maintainer.  Brian Kernighan occasionally dabbles in its development.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software Foundation, wrote [4mgawk[24m, to be compatible with the original version of  [4mawk[24m  distributed
       in Seventh Edition UNIX.  John Woods contributed a number of bug fixes.  David Trueman, with contributions from Arnold Robbins, made [4mgawk[0m
       compatible with the new version of UNIX [4mawk[24m.  Arnold Robbins is the current maintainer.

       See [4mGAWK:[24m [4mEffective[24m [4mAWK[24m [4mProgramming[24m for a full list of the contributors to [4mgawk[24m and its documentation.

       See the [1mREADME [22mfile in the [4mgawk[24m distribution for up-to-date information about maintainers and which ports are currently supported.

[1mBUG REPORTS AND QUESTIONS[0m
       If you find a bug in [4mgawk[24m, please use the [4mgawkbug[24m(1) program to report it.

       Full  instructions  for  reporting  a bug are provided in [4mhttps://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Bugs.html[24m.  [4mPlease[24m carefully
       read and follow the instructions given there.  This will make bug reporting and resolution much easier for everyone involved.  Really.

       On the other hand, if you have a question as to how to accomplish a particular task using [4mawk[24m or [4mgawk[24m, send an email to [1mhelp-gawk@gnu.org[0m
       with your request for help.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [1m-F [22moption is not necessary given the command line variable assignment feature; it remains only for backwards compatibility.

       This manual page is too long; [4mgawk[24m has too many features.
