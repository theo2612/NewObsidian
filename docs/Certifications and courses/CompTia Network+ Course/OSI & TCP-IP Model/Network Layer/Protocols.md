Protocols - currenty most protocols that start with I operate at level 3 (Except for [[IMAP]])- ICMP, IGRP, IGMP, IPSec  
  
ICMP - Internet Control Messaging Protocol  
Responsible for echoing utillities like Ping, Tracert, traceroute  
Ping is used to test basic physical connectivity for local and remote hosts  
If a ping fails perhaps use Tracert / Traceroute to see the hops to diagnose the problem  
where the ping fails  
Tracert for [[Windows]], Traceroute for [[Linux]] - Chases hops through routers  
Ping a local computer on my network - If I can reach it, great!  
Then I'll ping a remorte computer - One on the other side of the router / If I can't raeach that remote host I'll use Tracert/Traceroute so I can see the message leave from me  
Goes to Router 1, Goes to Router 2, Then It doesn't look like it will pass router 3
