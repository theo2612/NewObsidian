Processing  
  
1. **Physical**: Ensures the physical communication between the devices and converts an electrical pulse to binary. It defines the specific standard to which the physical components must comply to. The most commonly used protocols include the following, IEEE.802.11, IEEE.802.3 and several others.  
2. **Data link**: The Data link layer provides communication between directly connected devices. It also provides error handling for the OSI model's physical layer. It consists of two sub-layers, Media Access Control (MAC) and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layers. Most switches operate on the Data link layer or Layer 2 for communication, but there are exceptions where switches can also work on Layer 3 and are referred to as a Layer 3 switch where routing capabilities are required.  
3. **Network**: Routers function on the Network layer. This layer is responsible for forwarding packets to specific routes on the network. This layer analyses the packets received and determines if it has reached its destination and then passes it to the Transport layer. If it is not the final destination, it will pass it to the Data link layer until it reaches its final destination. The Network layer is also responsible for updating routing tables.  
4. **Transport**: The Transport layer’s function is to deliver data across network connections. The most commonly used protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Different protocols will have different functionalities when transporting data across the network. For example, error checking is done using the TCP protocol.  
5. **Session**: The OSI model's Session layer manages the flow and sequence of different network connections. This ensures the possibility for dynamic concurrent connections.  
6. **Presentation**: The simplest part of the OSI model is the Presentation layer, as it handles the processing and converting of the data, for example, encryption and decryption, to facilitate the support for the Application layer.  
7. **Application**: The final layer in the OSI model, the Application layer, provides network services to the application. These services include protocols that integrate into the application; for example, the HTTP protocol is used to deliver data to a web browser to display a user's web page.

If true - Physical connection looks good  
  
**Data Link - Layer 2**  
Provides point to point connectivity within our network  
Ex - packets to a switch,  
   
PDU/Protocol Data Unit - frame- Segment of data with beginning and end  
The Data Link layer is composed of two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) lower sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) upper sublayer. Components/protocols relevant to the Data Link layer include driver details, MAC filtering, and ARP tables.  
Responsible for framing, error detection and physical addressing  
A MAC address is a 12 digit hexadecimal number, which is a physical address of the network components.  
Switches operate at this level and maps to MAC address  
EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) - IPv6 global unicast  
Multi-layer switches operate at Data-link layer 2 and Network layer 3 layers  
Hub operate at this level - pass info to everyone on network  
Bridges operate at this level - point to point

 the LLC sublayer is implemented in the driver of the interface. The LLC takes care of the error-free transfer of data frames from one node to the other.  
   
 cmd  
-Viewing the MAC address of machine  
>ipconfig /all

Physical Address = MAC address of machine  
   
-There are several protocols that function at the Data Link layer. One of these is the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This protocol determines the MAC address that corresponds to the appropriate IP address.  
   
>arp -a  
 - shows arp table with corresponding MAC addresses  
   
**Network layer-**  
 IP addressing / Routing  
PDU/Protocol Data Unit - Packets, Segment of data.  
examine components of the Network layer of the OSI model. These components include the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for a device. Configuration details of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are a part of the Network layer.  
IP addresses are logical addresses mapped to a physical component  
Routers work at this level - Sometimes called layer 3 switch - Moves data across networks  
Responsible for routing and IP addressing  
Multi-layer switches operate at Data-link layer 2 and Network layer 3 layers  
   
   
 ipconfig /all  
View IPv4 address - The IPv4 address is a private IP address and can only be used on internal networks (not on the Internet)  
Subnet Mask -   indicates that the range of IP addresses in the same subnet are from  
Default gateway -

**Session Layer-**  
Provides connection management. Handshake, initiation, maintaining, who talks when  
This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communications between applications located on different devices  
The session layer provides mechanism to open, close and manage communication session between end-user applications. Communication sessions consist of requests and responses between applications.  
NFS/Network File system  
   
**Presentation Layer-**  
Formats data so it can be sent over a network, standardized or encrypted, or when received are formatting it so we can read it/put on computer and understand it  
Protocols - referring to presenting file types to the user , audio, visual, text etc  
   
The presentation layer is responsible for formatting and delivering information to the application for further processing or display. It relieves the application layer of concern regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems.  
Encryption device operates at this level - Formats data  
   
Examples of these layers functioning within the Windows environment include the use of NetBIOS names for the Session layer and character code translation such as from ASCII to EDCDIC and back.  
   
For the most part these functionalities cannot be directly viewed within a Windows environment as most Windows network components are structured around the TCP/IP model and as such, these layers are included within the Application layer.  
   
**Application Layer-**  
Different protocols that manage how applications are allowed to send and receive over the network.  
They manage how data is able to create sessions and use resources
