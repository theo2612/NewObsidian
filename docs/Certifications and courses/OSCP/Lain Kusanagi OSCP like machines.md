# Hackthebox		
- Start learning to Try harder here. Donâ€™t fully skip hackthebox some boxes have important concepts that are rare even in PG practice like SNMP and Keepass also AD ones are pretty good practice even if harder than OSCP in some ways. At the very least watch ippsec videos and take notes

# Tryhackme		
- More guided and friendly approach for some rooms but still great boxes and rooms for prep. Active Directory ones here are very good practice for the OSCP.

## Proving Grounds Practice
- The real OSCP like boxes, this is just a list with the ones that are best practice and removing the overly complicated ones that are too out of scope and those that were boxes meant to be mostly for OSEP and OSED (example Kyoto and Nara) that were in TJNull list plus adding some new ones

## Virtual Hacking Labs
- Very under rated platform with very OSCP like machines, people that have used it really recommend it for OSCP including me. It has been very crucial help for those that have failed attempts to be able to pass and they are good practice for standalones.
