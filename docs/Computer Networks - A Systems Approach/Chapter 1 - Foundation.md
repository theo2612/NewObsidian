# 1.1 Applications
- Groups of people who interact with the Internet
	- Users
	- Those who create applications
	- Those who operate or manage networks
	- Those who design and build devices and protocols that collectively make up the internet. 
- Classes of applications of the internet
	- Web
		- Webpages
		- Static images, links, text
	- Streaming of audio and video
		- Netflix, youtube.
		- The whole video file doesn't download at once.
	- Real-time Audio and video
		- Zoom, videoconferencing
		- even tighter constraints than streaming

# 1.2 Requirements
- Stakeholders and what they would list their requirements for a network
	- Application programmer
		- Services that their application needs
		- 
	- Network operator
		- Characteristics of a system that are easy to administer and manage
	- Network designer
		- Properties of a cost effective design
- Scale 
	- A system that is designed to support growth to an arbitrarily large size 
- Link 
	- a physical medium that directly connects 2 or more computers on a network
- nodes
	- Can be computers or other pieces of specialized hardware. 
	- pair of nodes are 'point to point'
	- more than 2 nodes are 'multiple-access'
- Types of networks
	- Direct Links
		- Point to Point
		- Multiple-access
	- Circuit switched
		- Telephone system
		- Optical networking
		- Nodes establish a dedicated circuit across a sequence of links and then allows. Then allows the source node to send a stream of bits across the circuit to the destination node
	- Packet Switched
		- Computer networks
		-  Use store and forward 
			- Each node receives complete packet, stores in internal memory & forwards complete packet to next node.
