We talked about domains in the previous task -- now lets talk about how they work.  
Ever wondered how a URL gets converted into an IP address that your computer can understand? The answer is a TCP/IP protocol called DNS (**D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem).  
At the most basic level, DNS allows us to ask a special server to give us the IP address of the website we're trying to access. For example, if we made a request to www.google.com, our computer would first send a request to a special DNS server (which your computer already knows how to find). The server would then go looking for the IP address for Google and send it back to us. Our computer could then send the request to the IP of the Google server.  
Let's break this down a bit.  
You make a request to a website. The first thing that your computer does is check its local cache to see if it's already got an IP address stored for the website; if it does, great. If not, it goes to the next stage of the process.  
Assuming the address hasn't already been found, your computer will then send a request to what's known as a _recursive_ DNS server. These will automatically be known to the router on your network. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers, but companies such as Google and OpenDNS also control recursive servers. This is how your computer automatically knows where to send the request for information: details for a recursive DNS server are stored in your router. This server will also maintain a cache of results for popular domains; however, if the website you've requested isn't stored in the cache, the recursive server will pass the request on to a _root name_ server.  
Before 2004 there were precisely 13 root name DNS servers in the world. These days there are many more; however, they are still accessible using the same 13 IP addresses assigned to the original servers (balanced so that you get the closest server when you make a request). The root name servers essentially keep track of the DNS servers in the next level down, choosing an appropriate one to redirect your request to. These lower level servers are called _Top-Level_ _Domain_ servers.  
Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for tryhackme**.com** your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled `.com` domains. If you were searching for bbc**.co.uk** your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handles `.co.uk` domains. As with root name servers, TLD servers keep track of the next level down: _Authoritative name servers_. When a TLD server receives your request for information, the server passes it down to an appropriate Authoritative name server.  
Authoritative name servers are used to store DNS records for domains directly. In other words, every domain in the world will have its DNS records stored on an Authoritative name server somewhere or another; they are the source of the information. When your request reaches the authoritative name server for the domain you're querying, it will send the relevant information back to you, allowing your computer to connect to the IP address behind the domain you requested.  
When you visit a website in your web browser this all happens automatically, but we can also do it manually with a tool called `dig` . Like ping and traceroute, dig should be installed automatically on Linux systems.  
Dig allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains:  
`dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>`  
It is a very useful tool for network troubleshooting.

This is a _lot_ of information. We're currently most interested in the `ANSWER` section for this room; however, taking the time to learn what the rest of this means is a very good idea. In summary, that information is telling us that we sent it one query and successfully (i.e. No Errors) received one full answer -- which, as expected, contains the IP address for the domain name that we queried.  
Another interesting piece of information that dig gives us is the TTL (**T**ime **T**o **L**ive) of the queried DNS record. As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache. The TTL of the record tells your computer when to stop considering the record as being valid -- i.e. when it should request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy.  
The TTL can be found in the second column of the answer section:

It's important to remember that TTL (in the context of DNS caching) is measured in _seconds,_ so the record in the example will expire in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.  
Have a go at some questions about DNS and dig.
