[PetitPotam - Github](https://github.com/ly4k/PetitPotam)
## What it is
Forces a target (often a Domain Controller) to authenticate to an attacker-controlled host via NTLM.

## Why it matters
- Enables NTLM relay
- Common path to AD CS abuse
- Can lead to Domain Admin under the right conditions

## Requirements
- Network access to target
- NTLM enabled
- Relay target available (e.g., AD CS, SMB, LDAP)

## Attack Flow
1. Trigger EFSRPC call
2. Target initiates NTLM auth
3. Relay authentication
4. Gain elevated access

## Detection / Artifacts
- EFSRPC traffic
- Unusual NTLM auth attempts
