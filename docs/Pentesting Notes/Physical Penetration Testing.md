- This is "      ", (Important position/title). We sent an email out to you recently about an employee recognition program but didn't get a reply.

**Quick Social Engineering pointers**

- Calling In?
	- Build a convincing Cover
	- Capitalize on you victims feeling on authority, fear, excitement and anxiety.
	- Always try to ease suspicions

- In person?
	- Tale on you phone and appear busy. People like to avoid conflict.
	- Appear to be in need of help. Spill a box of stuff at a building entrance, pick it up, and ask for help with the door.
	- Allow people to let you in to where you need to go. People tend not to report and even participate in tailgating.
