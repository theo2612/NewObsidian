	- Always try to ease suspicions

- In person?
	- Tale on you phone and appear busy. People like to avoid conflict.
	- Appear to be in need of help. Spill a box of stuff at a building entrance, pick it up, and ask for help with the door.
	- Allow people to let you in to where you need to go. People tend not to report and even participate in tailgating.
