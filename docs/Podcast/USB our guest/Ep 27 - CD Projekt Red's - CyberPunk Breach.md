Today's episode covers the CD Projekt Red's ransomware attack. The company CD Projekt Red made The Witcher series and hotly criticized Cyberpunk 2077. I have 2 great articles from wired and the knowbe4 blog in the show notes. 

 CyberPunk 2077 flew out the gate in December 2020 but has since been riddled with bugs and performance issues. So much so that Sony pulled the game from their online store as well as Microsoft offering refunds to players.

 Hackers have claimed to have stolen not only the source code for CyberPunk 2077 but also Personal identifiable info like investor relations, Human resources, and accounting data. CD Projekt Red reports that they have found no evidence that customer data was compromised. The hackers have threatened that without coming to some kind of agreement on ransom payment, that they will sell or outright release the source code online and the Personal identifiable info will be sold also. 

 What is interesting about this story is that CD Projekt Red has declined the hackers demand for ransom and that they will restore affected systems from backup. There is no guarantee that you will get your data back after you pay a ransom and sometimes the decryption key does not fully work. Also paying ransom encourages other bad guys to do the same thing and entices others to participate in the illegal activity. 

 Take a page from CD Projekt Red's playbook and start backing up your data. I even did an episode on Backups. I put a link in the show notes or just scroll up or down to get to it. By not paying ransoms you are effectively disrupting the hackers business model. Hard to do business deploying ransomware if no one is paying you, right? Back-up your data.

 Also, do not download any unauthorized version of cyberpunk2077. It is most likely malicious. Download only from Playstation, XBOX, Stadia or Steam
