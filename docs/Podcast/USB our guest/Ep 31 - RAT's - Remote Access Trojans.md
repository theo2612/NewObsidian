 Hello and welcome back to USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips. I’m Theo and Today’s episode covers RATs or Remote Access Trojans. There is a great article on DarkReading that gives an overview of what RATs do and I’ll include it in the show notes. In This episode we will cover What are RATs, how do they find their way on your computer, what they do when they find themselves on there and what you can do to protect your device from them. 

  

So What are RAT’s or Remote Access Trojans? 

To understand RAT’s Let’s start at the end with Trojans. A Trojan virus or Malware is simply malware concealed as something safe to download. Remote Access is allowing your device or computer to be accessed remotely by someone else’s machine. If you’ve ever had IT at work remote into your computer to install updates or fix your printer - This is a version of Remote Access. 

  

How do RAT’s find their way on your computer? 

RAT’s are usually installed on your computer by you. That’s right, they are disguised as that free version of Photoshop, a Zoom installer from a link from a sus- email, or as we’ll learn in an upcoming episode, cheat codes or modifications for PC games such as minecraft, CS:GO, Fortnite or Valorant.

  

What do they do on your computer?

Once installed the RAT will typically attempt the remote part of its name by contacting its command and control server for instructions. The RAT could be instructed to start logging keystrokes, recording the screen, webcam and/or microphone. A RAT infected computer could become part of a bot-net where large numbers of other infected computers can be used to execute Denial-of-service attacks. With the popularity of cryptocurrency, some infected machines may become unwilling cryptominers. The long and short is once a RAT is installed and given it’s instructions, it can become whatever the bad guys want it to be. 

  

How can you protect your device from them?

 My best advice? Only download from official sources. Want MSOffice? Go to microsoft.com. Valorant? Buy from Steam or Valorant’s store page. 

 Never click on links in email, text, discord, twitter, or any other messenger to download software. It doesn't even matter if it’s from you Moms.Never. Click on a link. In any messenger.
