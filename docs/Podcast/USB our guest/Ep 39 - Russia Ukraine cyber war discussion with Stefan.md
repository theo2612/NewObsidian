STATE MEDIA ATTACK Earlier in March, the group siphoned control of Russian state television and Russian streaming services and broadcasted footage of battlefields in Ukraine. GOVERNMENT WEBSITES HACKED Six Russian Government websites were taken down in February, according to Ukraine’s state telecommunications agency.

    SPACE AGENCY SHUT DOWN The group claimed to have [shut down Russia’s space agency]([https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17818843/anonymous-russia-space-agency-roscosmos/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17818843/anonymous-russia-space-agency-roscosmos/ "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/17818843/anonymous-russia-space-agency-roscosmos/")), Roscosmos. The hacking team said that Russian officials have "no more control over their spy satellites." However, the Director-General of Roscosmos, Dmitry Olegovich Rogozin, denied the claim and called the group "petty swindlers." In a social media statement, he said: "The information of these scammers and petty swindlers is not true. All our space activity control centers are operating normally." PUTIN'S SUPERYACHT Putin’s £73million superyacht was renamed “FCKPTN” with its destination changed to “Hell” after Anonymous claimed to have targeted his assets. The group broke into the ship's maritime data and made it appear as if it had crashed into Snake Island in Ukraine. The vigilante group then renamed the boat's destination to "anonymous" and "anonleaks" before settling with "hell" or "FCKPTN". HACKED PRINTERS AND CAMERAS On March 21, it was reported the group had hacked unsecured printers across Russia, proceeding to mass print information about the war to circumvent the Kremlin’s state propaganda. Over 160 devices were targeted with 40,000 copies printed with anti-war messages written in Russian. The copies also contained information on how civilians can bypass censorship in the country by using the Tor browser.
