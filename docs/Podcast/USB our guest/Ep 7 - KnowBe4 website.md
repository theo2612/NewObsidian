Hey, How's it going? Thanks for adding "USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips" to your flash briefing

Today's Tip is about the knowbe4 blog. The link will be in the show notes

Knowbe4 is the worldâ€™s largest security awareness training and simulated phishing platform that helps you manage the ongoing problem of social engineering.

Since they focus on Security Awareness training, their website focuses on business solutions. 

However, they have a blog that publishes articles daily. These articles highlight new breaches, exploits, and scams. 

They sort their articles into 5 categories; Security awareness training, Phishing, Cybercrime, Socail Engineering, Ransomware and Articles solely written by Knowbe4 staff. 

My personal favorite is Social Enginering. This is a common attack vector for cyber criminals and they can be quite humorus. 

They even have a 'Scam of the week' where they dive deep into a scam and it's variants to help you better identify and not fall for it

In my opinion staying up to date on scams and attacks is one of the best ways to prevent yourself for falling for them.

Do your self a favor and bookmark blog.know, the letters B E and the #4.com

Thank you again for listening and we'll talk to you again tomorrow.
