Hello.  Welcome back and Thanks for adding "USB our Guest Cyber Security Tips" to your flash briefing. 

Today's tip is about the Hacking Humans podcast by Cyberwire with Dave Bitner and Joe Carrigan. 

Daily, Dave Bitner hosts the CyberWire. As descibed on their website, they distill the day’s critical cyber security news into a concise daily podcast. It can be a bit technical at times but its a great resource to keep up to date on current Cyber Security News

However, Weekly, Dave and Joe record Hacking Humans. They look at trending social engineering scams and phishing schemes. They also interview social engineering experts, security pros, and those practiced in the arts of deception.  We also hear from people targeted by social engineering attacks and learn from their experiences.

Hacking Humans is a great way to keep yourself armed with knowledge to stay infront of these schemes. 

In the episodes, Dave and Joe both share an article or a story about social engineering scam and then do an excellent job of identifying and explaining how these schemes work and how much damage they can cause. 

They also have a segment called 'Catch of the day'. Where they often do a dramatic reading of a scam, where Dave and Joe will read as the scammer or the person getting scammed. They can be very funny, but again, this is intended to help you more quickly identify the scam, so you are not fooled by it.
