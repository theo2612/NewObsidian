<p>I’m Brad Theodore and before I tell you about me.</p>
<p>My Wife <strong>Amy</strong>. She’s a saint. They got a cloud waiting
for her. She’s seen me at my absolute best and worst and keeps me. Our
family is one of the most inspiring forces in my life. [[Pasted image

<p>Our 2 kids. <strong>Dominic and Rosie</strong>
<strong>Dominic</strong> He runs cross country and track and has almost
lettered in both and has a 4.0 currently. [[Pasted image

<p><strong>Rosie</strong> She consumes books like I consume Reese’s
cups, quickly. She swims and plays soccer. Well not really play, she is
an animal out there, not afraid of someone bigger than her. In fact, I’m
pretty sure she looks for em. Yeah. [[Pasted image

<p><strong>And me</strong> - I have a bachelors in Hospitality
Management from YSU, - I’ve worked in the Restaurant, Beverage and
Trucking industries. I firmly believe that my time spent in those
industries has prepared me for my career in Cyber Security. - I work for
Rea and Associates as a Pen-Tester and I love what I do. It is one of
the most frustrating and rewarding journeys I’ve embarked on. - Who
knows what a pen tester is ? </p>
<p>I’m a hacker? No a <strong>Pen Tester</strong> <strong>Clicky

<p><strong>Twisty bottoms</strong> [[Pasted image

<h2 id="engagements">Engagements</h2>
<p>Some engagements are easy and some not so much.  - One was an
external pentest of a website with bill pay. Through a dirbuster scan I
found a wordpress login page exposed to the internet. While booting my
password cracking software, I tried admin/admin, and that logged me in.
I had access for a week no one booted me off the website, even while
logging in and out multiple times. One of the times it asked me to
confirm my contact email, which I could have changed. Also, with admin
access to the wordpress site, I could have pointed the bill pay address
to spoofed website and redirected payments. - Another time it was an all
html website with a db that was meant to be open to the internet. I was
diving through piles of CVE’s hoping one was unpatched. a week later I
still did not have access.</p>
<h2 id="more-background-about-me">More Background about me</h2>
<p>I have a masters in Information Technology with a concentration in
Cyber Security. I did a lot of academic paper reading and hands on work.
but truth be told a lot of my actual hands on experience came after
university. I compiled a list of my favorite platforms for continuous
education.</p>
