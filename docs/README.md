## Hi There. 
- I'm Theo/7h30 and you've stumbled upon my cybersecurity notebook for continuing education. 
- Every time I learn something new, I jot it down in this notebook. Most subjects are incomplete. I learn what I need to know and move on.
- The notebook is mostly red team  with a few blue team items sprinkled in.
