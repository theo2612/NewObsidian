## Hi There. 
- I'm Theo/7h30 and you've stumbled upon my cybersecurity notebook for continuing education. 
- Every time I work on a machine on HTB or learn something new, I jot it down in this notebook. Some subjects are incomplete because I often identify gaps in my knowledge, learn what I need to know and jot it down.
- The notebook is mostly red team  with a few blue team items sprinkled in.
