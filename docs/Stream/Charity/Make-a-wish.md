- The Make-A-Wish Foundation's mission is to grant life-changing wishes to children with critical illnesses.
- These wishes are more than just a nice thing. And they are far more than gifts, or singular events in time. 
- Wishes impact everyone involvedâ€”wish kids, volunteers, donors, sponsors, medical professionals and communities. 
	- For wish kids, just the act of making their wish come true can give them the courage to comply with their medical treatments. 
	- Parents might finally feel like they can be optimistic. 
	- And still others might realize all they have to offer the world through volunteer work or philanthropy.
