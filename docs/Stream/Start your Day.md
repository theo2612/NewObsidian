[General McRaven's Commencement speech]([[https]]://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaQZFhrW0fU)
General McRaven's commencement speech at the University of Texas in 2014 was a powerful call to action, drawing upon his experiences as a Navy SEAL to offer valuable life lessons. These timeless pieces of advice, drawn from McRaven's experiences, serve as a guiding light for anyone striving to make a positive impact and change the world for the better.
Here's a summary of his speech, highlighting the 10 pieces of advice he shared:

1. **Start with Making Your Bed:** McRaven emphasized the importance of starting the day with a simple task completed, like making your bed. This sets the tone for accomplishing more tasks throughout the day, no matter how small they may seem. *Start each day with a task completed*
    
2. **Find Someone to Help You Paddle:** Just as in SEAL training, where teamwork is essential, McRaven encouraged the graduates to seek help and collaborate with others in their journey through life. *Find someone to help you get through life*
    
3. **Measure a Person by the Size of Their Heart:** Using the example of the "munchkin" boat crew, he emphasized that true success is not determined by physical attributes or background, but by the strength of character and determination. *Respect Everyone*
    
4. **Get Over Being a Sugar Cookie:** Facing setbacks and failures is inevitable, but it's essential to persevere and keep moving forward, even when things don't go as planned. *Know that life is not fair and you will fail often*
    
5. **Don't Be Afraid of the Circuses:** Challenges and failures are part of life, but they also build resilience and strength. Embracing these difficulties rather than avoiding them is crucial for growth. *Don't be afraid of failure, learn from it*
    
6. **Sometimes You Have to Slide Down the Obstacles Head First:** Taking calculated risks and approaching obstacles with unconventional methods can lead to unexpected success, as demonstrated by the student who broke the obstacle course record. *Take Risks, *
    
7. **Don't Back Down from the Sharks:** Confronting fears and challenges head-on is necessary for achieving goals. McRaven used the metaphor of sharks to represent the obstacles one might encounter in life. *Face down the bullies*
    
8. **Be Your Very Best in the Darkest Moments:** During the most challenging times, it's essential to remain calm, composed, and resilient. These moments define one's character and ability to overcome adversity. *Step up when times are the toughest*
    
9. **Start Singing When You're Up to Your Neck in Mud:** Maintaining hope and positivity, even in the toughest situations, can inspire others and lead to eventual success. *Lift up the downtrodden*
    
10. **Don't Ever, Ever Ring the Bell:** Lastly, McRaven urged the graduates never to give up, no matter how difficult the journey may become. Success comes to those who persevere and refuse to quit. *Never, ever give up*
