US GOV - SP 800-171 Rev. 2 - Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf) 

US GOV Publication pdf [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-2/final](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-2/final)  

NIST SP 800-171 (National institute of Standards and Technology special publication 800-171) is a set of security standards that apply to nonfederal information systems and orgs that process, store, or transmit controlled unclassified information (CUI). CUI is information that is not classified but is still sensitive and requires protection from unauthorized disclosure. 

The purpose of NST SP 800-171 is to help organizations that handle CUI to protect it from unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction. It outlines a set of security controls and assessment procedures that organizations can use to secure their information systems and data, and provides guidance on how to implement and assess these controls 

NIST SP 800-171 outlines 14 families of security controls that organizations can implement to protect CUI: 
1. Access control: controls designed to ensure that only authorized users have access to CUI. 
2. Awareness and training: controls designed to ensure that users are aware of the security risks associated with their work and are trained to identify and mitigate those risks. 
3. Audit and accountability: controls designed to ensure that all actions taken on the information system are recorded and can be traced back to the responsible user.
4.  Configuration management: controls designed to ensure that the information system is configured in a secure manner and that any changes to its configuration are properly documented and authorized.
5. Identification and authentication: controls designed to ensure that users can be uniquely identified and that their identity can be verified.
6. Incident response: controls designed to ensure that the organization has a plan in place to respond to and recover from security incidents involving CUI.
7. Maintenance: controls designed to ensure that the information system is properly maintained and that any changes to it are carefully controlled.
8. Media protection: controls designed to ensure that media containing CUI is properly protected.
9. Physical and environmental protection: controls designed to ensure the physical security of the information system and the environment in which it operates.
10. Personnel security: controls designed to ensure that personnel with access to CUI have been properly screened and are trustworthy.
11. Risk assessment: controls designed to ensure that the organization has a process in place to identify and assess potential risks to CUI.
12. Security assessment and authorization: controls designed to ensure that the information system has been properly evaluated and that any identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
13. System and communications protection: controls designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information system and its communications.
14. System and information integrity: controls designed to ensure that CUI is accurate and has not been compromised.    

Organizations that implement the security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-171 help ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CUI they handle, and protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## NIST SP 800-53 

US GOV - SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)  

US GOV PDF - [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf)  

NIST SP 800-53 is a set of security standards that are designed to protect information systems and the information they process, store, or transmit. These controls are intended to help organizations secure their information systems against threats including unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.  

NIST SP 800-53 outlines 18 families of security controls, each of which addresses a different aspect of information security:  

1. Access control: controls designed to ensure that only authorized users have access to the information system and its resources.
2. Awareness and training: controls designed to ensure that users are aware of the security risks associated with their work and are trained to identify and mitigate those risks.
3. Audit and accountability: controls designed to ensure that all actions taken on the information system are recorded and can be traced back to the responsible user.
4. Certification, accreditation, and security assessment: controls designed to ensure that the information system has been properly evaluated and that any identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
5. Configuration management: controls designed to ensure that the information system is configured in a secure manner and that any changes to its configuration are properly documented and authorized.
6. Continuous monitoring: controls designed to ensure that the information system is regularly assessed to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
7. Identification and authentication: controls designed to ensure that users can be uniquely identified and that their identity can be verified.
8. Incident response: controls designed to ensure that the organization has a plan in place to respond to and recover from security incidents.
9. Maintenance: controls designed to ensure that the information system is properly maintained and that any changes to it are carefully controlled.
10. Media protection: controls designed to ensure that media containing sensitive information is properly protected.
11. Physical and environmental protection: controls designed to ensure the physical security of the information system and the environment in which it operates.
12. Personnel security: controls designed to ensure that personnel with access to the information system have been properly screened and are trustworthy.
13. Risk assessment: controls designed to ensure that the organization has a process in place to identify and assess potential risks to the information system.
14. Security assessment and authorization: controls designed to ensure that the information system has been properly evaluated and that any identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
15. Security management: controls designed to ensure that the organization has a process in place for managing and controlling security-related activities.
16. System and communications protection: controls designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information system and its communications.
17. System and information integrity: controls designed to ensure that the information stored on the information system is accurate and has not been compromised.
18. Telecommunications: controls designed to ensure the secure operation of the organization's telecommunications systems.     

Overall, NIST SP 800-53 is a comprehensive set of security controls and guidelines that are designed to protect the information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
