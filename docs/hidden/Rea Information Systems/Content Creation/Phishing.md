 Today's Tip is about Phishing.

 What is Phishing? 

 Phishing is the practice of sending emails masquerading as a trusted entity, like the government, a business or your mom to fool someone into revealing personal info such as passwords or credit card numbers.Â  Every type of communication has it's own type of phishing. For this tip we are focusing on email phishing. 

 A phishing email will look like an email from Amazon saying that your delivery is delayed and to click the tracking number to fix, and then redirecting you to a fake sign in screen for Amazon where your credentials will be stole if you enter them. Or an email from netflix asking you to update your payment details and asking you to click on a button that says "update account now". Then redirecting you to a fake netflix account screen where your credit card number will be stolen if you enter your info. 

 Other phishing attempts could say, you must confirm personal info, include a fake invoice, say you're eligible for a government refund or offer a coupon for free items.

The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack, or the revealing of sensitive information.

 If you think you are being phished, Don't click on anything. Pause for a moment, and call the government agency, the company or your mom from a phone number listed on their website or invoice. Do not call a number found in the suspected phishing email or in links that the email takes you to.

We offer the following suggestions to protect yourself from a phishing attack

 First, protect your phone and Computer from attack by setting them to automatically update. Almost all major Technology companies include security fixes to their updates. Any amount of time that you do not install them is leaving your device vulnerable to an attack. 

 Second, enable Two-factor or Multi-factor authentication on all of your accounts that offer it. 2FA or MFA increases the security on your accounts by requiring more than one authentication credential to verify your identity for login. For instance, to access your email you would be required to supply your password and then a token from a authenticator app that only lives on your device. If a bad guy got a hold of your password from a phishing email, they would be unable to access your email with out the token from your authenticator app.
