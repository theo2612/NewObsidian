# **Website or Internal/External Network Pentest**
- **Ping domain for ip address**
- **Scan ip address for all open ports**
	- using nmap ``` sudo nmap -p- -T4 -vv -O --min-rate 20000 -Pn ip.ip.ip.ip ```
			-p- scans all 6535 ports
			-T4 sets the timing template  to 4 (0-5). Speeds up scan but possibly less accurete
			-vv increases verbosity of output
			-O enables OS detection
			--min-rate 20000 sends a min of 20,000 packets/sec speeding up the scan but can overwhelm the target. OPTIONAL
			-Pn Treats all hosts as offline. skips the discovery phase- nmap will attempt to scan every port on the target without doind a pre-lim check to see if it is up
			ip.ip.ip.ip is the ipaddress target

- **identify services and versions running on those ports from previous scan**
	- using nmap ``` nmap -p 3306 -sV -sC -Pn ip.ip.ip.ip ```
		-p 3306 Scan only port 3306    
		-sV Version detection. nmap tries to determine the version of the service running on the port.
		-sC: Run default script scan. This uses the built-in scripts in `nmap` to perform various checks and additional information gathering on the target.
		-Pn: Treat all hosts as online. This skips the discovery phase, so `nmap` doesn't check first to see if the target is online; it just starts scanning.
		10.129.156.28 : The target IP address that you're scanning.
