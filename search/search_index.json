Make sure to learn python in here (if you don't already know it) \u2013 that is key! </p> <p>Day 1337++ Go for [[tryhackme]]'s offensive path. Skip the [[buffer overflow]] for now, but do everything else. If this is too challenging go to complete beginner path then return. If you aren't ready go to the cyber mentor and do the Practical Ethical Hacking Complete course. </p> <p>Day 8080 You need to learn some webhacking. Go for portswigger academy, unless you have the resources to take GWAPT or eWAPT. You should know and be comfortable with [[burp]] intruder, proxy, intercepting, repeater. These are your go to! </p> <p>Day 31337 You are almost there! Go to TCM academy and do both [[windows]] + [[linux]] privesc courses. Take notes! Practice using autorecon on the boxes you privesc. You will use this for pwk and [[oscp]]. </p> <p>Day 65535 Do the shortest possible lab time for PWK (30 days). Ignore the pdf and videos. Ignore the [[buffer overflow]]. Go straight to the boxes. You should get about 1-2 boxes per night of effort. 3-4 on a full Saturday. With 15 days of straight effort (plan for it!). Aim for 50 boxes pwned in 30 days and you are in a good spot to pass. Do not go straight into the exam! Post PWK Pre-Exam Prep Do you know microsoft word really well? If not go learn it. You have 24 hours post lab to write a report. If you are young and new, this is a gap. Install greenshot, learn how it works and inverts colors etc. Practice saving the screenshots and pasting them into a document, etc. You will take many many screenshots. Go do as much of TJ Null's [[HTB]] list as you can stand. I did 90% of it. Review privesc. Review privesc. Review your weaknesses. Then review them again. Review the [[OSCP]] exam rules, the proctoring info, etc. Make checklists of what you need to submit, and how. Understand the rules really really well. SNAPSHOT your vm when it is in a good state. Trust me on this. My VM went borked right before the exam. I reverted to a working snapshot easily. Now go and do [[tryhackme]]'s [[buffer overflow]] room. This is all you need to do.

Like docs/Pentesting Notes/Attacks/Hacking Tools/Network Exploitation/Network Services/ftp, NFS is used to transfer files. They are still quite different. While docs/Pentesting Notes/Attacks/Hacking Tools/Network Exploitation/Network Services/ftp uses a client-server model to communicate, NFS acts as a distributed system. This means that a user can access a share(think of this as a directory) on their own file system. While docs/Pentesting Notes/Attacks/Hacking Tools/Network Exploitation/Network Services/ftp uses username and password to manage authentication and authorization to files, NFS uses the [[linux]] permission system to manage these things. Common misconfigurations include: Publicly accessible shares: some administrators may expose NFS shares to anyone. An attacker could mount the share onto their file system and access files on the share. When the permissions a file are different, an attacker would have to change their user ID/group ID to match the permissions of the file. The first step would be enumerating a system to check if NFS is running. Once NFS is running, we would check to see if any shares are available. This is done using this command showmount -e ip-address This command shows all the shares exported by NFS. KOTH Notes 8 If this command outputs any shares, you can try mount the shares on to your file system mount ip:/file/path /local/file/path Note that this command would require sudo permissions Once it is successfully mounted, you can browse to the location on your file system and try access the files. After completing this, you need to unmount the file system using the command: umount /local/file/path Note that this command would require sudo permissions [[Windows]] (In Progress) [[windows]] search for files: dir /b/s *.txt Random list of stuff for now.

The <code>\\\\</code> indicates the beginning of the server name, and <code>test.local</code> is the NetBIOS name or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server. It's important to note that if you're using an IP address instead of a hostname, you should omit the <code>\\\\</code>. <code>-I 10.10.221.31</code>: This option specifies the IP address of the target server. It's used to explicitly set the server's IP address instead of relying on name resolution.

All the layers are essential for us to be able to go on the internet. Each layer has a purpose that allows us to do our daily tasks.  </p> <p>The diagram on the left is a good example of the OSI 7 Layer System. The diagram also has some examples for each layer and how each layer works. With the help of the diagram we can get a basic understanding of the OSI 7 Layer System.  </p> <p>Layer 1 \u2014 Physical  </p> <p>The first layer of the Open System Interconnection Model covers all physical aspects of the network. This includes the wiring/cabling of the system, the bit stream and the hardware. The specific services in which this layer provides includes:  </p> <p>Signal converting for physical transmission (encoding and decoding physical signals)  </p> <p>Bit by bit transmission  </p> <p>Line coding  </p> <p>Synchronisation of bits  </p> <p>Transmission mode control  </p> <p>Collision detection  </p> <p>Carrier sensing  </p> <p>The physical layer must encode a signal into an analogue signal to be transmitted. Depending on the mode of transmission (wired or wireless), the signal will be converted to either electrical pulses, light, or electromagnetic waves. [9:33 AM] Layer 2 \u2014 Data Link  </p> <p>Secondly, the Data Link layer handles the links and transfer of data in/out the physical network. The bits of data sent from the physical layer are encoded, decoded, organised and checks for problems. Depending on which way the data is travelling (sent or receiving), the data will either be encoded to be sent to physical or decoded being sent from physical.  </p> <p>This layer breaks down into 2 more sub layers:  </p> <p>Logical Link Control  </p> <p>Media Access Control  </p> <p>Media access control oversees permissions for the data, granting or denying access to devices.  </p> <p>Logical Link Control maintains the data flow among services including the preparation of data for transport, identifying protocols of the network layer and \u201cframing\u201d of data. Synchronisation of data and error checking are also handed by this layer.  </p> <p>Packets of data from the Network layer are framed, giving them a header and trailer. The header includes the destination address, and type of data. [9:33 AM] Layer 3 \u2014 Network  </p> <p>Seen as the backbone of the entire system, the network layer\u2019s purpose is to provide data routing paths for packets of data to be transferred. It manages the best logical path for data transfer between nodes.  </p> <p>Some of the communication protocols of this layer include:  </p> <p>IP (Internet protocol) (v4/v6)  </p> <p>IPX (Internetwork Packet Change)  </p> <p>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)  </p> <p>IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)  </p> <p>Network layer protocols exist in every host or router. The router examines the header fields of all the IP packets that pass through it. [9:33 AM] Layer 4 \u2014 Transport  </p> <p>The transport layer provides the transport of the data between users. This is an important layer of the OSI System as it controls the reliability of the data that is send through the flow control.  </p> <p>The transport layer is also responsible for managing error correction, providing the end user\u2019s quality and reliability. This layer allows the host to send and receive correct data, packets or messages over a network, and is the network component that allows multiplexing.  </p> <p>The transport layers work transparently within the above layers to deliver and receive error-free data. The sender pauses application messages into segments and sends them to the network layer. The inviting part reassembles segments in messages and transmits them to the application level.  </p> <p>The transport layer may offer some or all the following services:  </p> <p>Same Delivery Order: Ensures that packets are always delivered in strict sequence. Although the network layer is responsible, the transport layer can fix any discrepancies in sequence caused by packet drops or device interruption.  </p> <p>Data Integrity: Using checksums, the data integrity across all the delivery layers can be ensured.  </p> <p>Flow Control: Devices at each end of a network connection often have no way of knowing each other\u2019s capabilities in terms of data throughput and can therefore send data faster than the receiving device is able to buffer or process it.  </p> <p>Traffic Control: Digital communications networks are subject to bandwidth and processing speed restrictions, which can mean a huge amount of potential for data congestion on the network. This network congestion can affect almost every part of a network. The transport layer can identify the symptoms of overloaded nodes and reduced flow rates. [9:33 AM] Layer 5 \u2014 Session  </p> <p>In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the session layer is the fifth layer, which controls the connections between multiple computers. The session layer tracks the dialog\u2019s between computers, which are also called sessions. This layer establishes, controls and ends the sessions between local and remote applications.  </p> <p>The session layer manages a session by initiating the opening and closing of sessions between end-user application processes. This layer also controls single or multiple connections for each end-user application, and directly communicates with both the presentation and the transport layers. The services offered by the session layer are generally implemented in application environments using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). Sessions are most implemented on Web browsers using protocols such as the Zone Information Protocol, the AppleTalk Protocol and the Session Control Protocol.  </p> <p>These protocols also manage session restoration through checkpointing and recovery.  </p> <p>The session layer supports full-duplex and half-duplex operations and creates procedures for checkpointing, adjournment, restart and termination. The session layer is also responsible for synchronising information from different sources. For example, sessions are implemented in live television programs in which the audio and video streams emerging from two different sources are merged. This avoids overlapping and silent broadcast time. [9:33 AM] Layer 6 \u2014 Presentation  </p> <p>The Presentation layer takes care of the encryption, presentation and working out the right file formats needed. This is the Translation Layer that we need to get the data from the internet.  </p> <p>Residing at Layer 6 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model, the presentation layer ensures that the communications that pass through it are in the appropriate form for the recipient application. In other words, it presents the data in a readable format from an application layer perspective.  </p> <p>For example, a presentation layer program could format a file transfer request in binary code to ensure a successful file transfer. Because binary is the most rudimentary of computing languages, it ensures that the receiving device will be able to decipher and translate it into a format the application layer understands and is expecting. The application layer passes data meant for transport to another device in a certain format. The presentation layer then prepares this data in the most appropriate format the receiving application can understand.  </p> <p>Common formats include ASCII and extended binary-coded decimal interchange code (EBCDIC) for text, it can also be called Extended ASCII.; JPEG, GIF and TIFF for images; and MPEG, MP4 and QuickTime for video.  </p> <p>Encryption and decryption of data communications are also commonly performed at the presentation layer. Here, encryption methods and keys are exchanged between the two communicating devices. Thus, only the sender and receiver can properly encode and decode data, so it returns to a readable format. [9:34 AM] Layer 7 \u2014 Application  </p> <p>The Seventh Layer also known as the Application layer and it handles the end user processes. This layer takes care of the communication, identification, connectivity and privacy between the two services.  </p> <p>Positioned at Layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model, the transport layer ensures the reliable arrival of messages across a network and provides error-checking mechanisms and data flow controls.  </p> <p>The transport layer takes application messages and transmits those message segments into Layer 3, the networking layer. Once the receiving side has the segments, they are reassembled into messages and passed on to Layer 7, the application layer.  </p> <p>The functions of the transport layer are:  </p> <p>Connection mode and connection less mode transmissions. For connection mode transmissions, a transmission may be sent or arrive in the form of packets that need to be reconstructed into a complete message at the other end. Connection mode transmissions also require acknowledgement from the receiving device as an assurance.  </p> <p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most common form of connection-oriented transmission today. The connections are identified and tracked using port numbers that range between 0 and 65,535. One useful benefit of TCP is that it uses a positive acknowledgement with re-transmission technique where the receiving device must respond back to the sender that it indeed received the data it was sent.  </p> <p>The User Data Protocol (UDP) is an example of a connection-less-oriented protocol. Similar to TCP, UDP uses port numbers between 0 and 65,535 for identification and tracking of data transmission streams. But unlike TCP, which requires acknowledgement from the receiving device, UDP provides no guarantee mechanism. Because of this, UDP is ideal for real-time, streaming data transmissions, like voice and video conferencing.  </p> <p>Same order delivery. This makes sure packets are delivered in a specific sequence. Each packet is given a number and the receiver reorders the packets.  </p> <p>Data integrity. There are various ways packets might be lost or corrupted. Packets may also be delivered in the wrong order. Using error detection codes, such as a checksum, the transport layer ensures the data is not corrupted by sending an acknowledgement message to the sender.  </p> <p>Flow control. The sending device may transmit data at a faster rate than the memory capacity on the receiving device is able to process. In order to avoid having the receiving device overwhelmed with data, flow control manages the traffic so that it\u2019s at an acceptable rate. It also addresses data flow when the receiver is not getting data fast enough.  </p> <p>Congestion avoidance. The transport layer manages traffic and circumvents congestion by understanding where nodes or links are oversubscribed and then taking the proper steps to reduce the rate at which packets are sent, among other remedies.  </p> <p>Multiplexing. Packet streams can come from unrelated applications and a variety of sources. This permits the use of different applications or services across a network, such as when a user opens different browsers on the same computer.</p>"},{"location":"Certifications%20and%20courses/CompTia%20Network%2B%20Course/OSI%20%26%20TCP-IP%20Model/OSI%20--%20TCP-IP%20Model/","title":"OSI    TCP IP Model","text":"nmonic layer All Application People Presentation Seem Session To Transport Need Network Data Data Processing Physical [[https]]://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13769-5.html <p>[[https]]://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjj592ixOfmAhWCGc0KHf8uDhUQjRx6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=[[https]]%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.cisco.com%2Ft5%2Fswitching%2Fosi-and-tcp-ip-model%2Ftd-p%2F2167494&amp;psig=AOvVaw2iYBzihaPm5Onmo_vZeZ_t&amp;ust=1578144390703912 760 \u00d7 348 </p> <p>OSI Model - The Open Systems Interconnection Model [[https]]://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model [[https]]://www.tutorialspoint.com/ipv4/ipv4_osi_model.htm</p>"},{"location":"Certifications%20and%20courses/CompTia%20Network%2B%20Course/OSI%20%26%20TCP-IP%20Model/OSI%20--%20TCP-IP%20Model/#i","title":"i","text":"<p>Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pete Alligator Please Decide Now To Suck Penis Again  </p> <p>TCP/IP Model - Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol [[https]]://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite [[https]]://www.tutorialspoint.com/ipv4/ipv4_tcpip_model.htm</p>"},{"location":"Certifications%20and%20courses/CompTia%20Network%2B%20Course/OSI%20%26%20TCP-IP%20Model/Presentation%20Layer/","title":"Presentation Layer","text":"<p>Presentation Layer- Layer 6 3 Things happen at the Presentation layer Formatting - Presenting the in a universal format If sending messages from a Mac to a [[Windows]] PC, both can understand the message because at somepoint the message has been formatted to a universal format Multimedia Formatting - JPG, GIF, MP3  </p> <p>Compression - Removes redundancies from files allows files to be smaller as it is transported across the network so it doesn't take as long/ So it take as much space to transfer  </p> <p>Encryption - Layer 6 - happens within the filing system using EFS and sending a file that is encrypted storing a file in encrypted format somewhere within the filing system happens in multiple layers of the OSI model layer 1 - hardware based encyption layer 3 - IPsec - secures traffic layer 4-7 - SSL and TLS - secures web traffic  </p> <p>Only layer of the OSI model not to have protocols  </p> <p>Formats data so it can be sent over a network, standardized or encrypted, or when received are formatting it so we can read it/put on computer and understand it Protocols - referring to presenting file types to the user , audio, visual, text etc  The presentation layer is responsible for formatting and delivering information to the application for further processing or display.

It also provides error handling for the OSI model's physical layer. It consists of two sub-layers, Media Access Control (MAC) and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layers.

This is the Application layer of the OSI model in action.  </p> <p>[[TryHackMe]] - OSI model review The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.  </p> <p>The OSI model consists of seven layers:  </p> <p>Table showing the OSI layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical  </p> <p>There are many mnemonics floating around to help you learn the layers of the OSI model -- search around until you find one that you like.  </p> <p>I personally favour: Anxious Pale Shakespeare Treated Nervous Drunks Patiently  </p> <p>Let's briefly take a look at each of these in turn:  </p> <p>Layer 7 -- Application:  </p> <p>The application layer of the OSI model essentially provides networking options to programs running on a computer. It works almost exclusively with applications, providing an interface for them to use in order to transmit data. When data is given to the application layer, it is passed down into the presentation layer.  </p> <p>Layer 6 -- Presentation:  </p> <p>The presentation layer receives data from the application layer. This data tends to be in a format that the application understands, but it's not necessarily in a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in the receiving computer. The presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format, as well as handling any encryption, compression or other transformations to the data. With this complete, the data is passed down to the session layer.  </p> <p>Layer 5 -- Session:  </p> <p>When the session layer receives the correctly formatted data from the presentation layer, it looks to see if it can set up a connection with the other computer across the network. If it can't then it sends back an error and the process goes no further. If a session can be established then it's the job of the session layer to maintain it, as well as co-operate with the session layer of the remote computer in order to synchronise communications. The session layer is particularly important as the session that it creates is unique to the communication in question. This is what allows you to make multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all the data getting mixed up (think about opening two tabs in a web browser at the same time)! When the session layer has successfully logged a connection between the host and remote computer the data is passed down to Layer 4: the transport Layer.  </p> <p>Layer 4 -- Transport:  </p> <p>The transport layer is a very interesting layer that serves numerous important functions. Its first purpose is to choose the protocol over which the data is to be transmitted. The two most common protocols in the transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol); with TCP the transmission is connection-based which means that a connection between the computers is established and maintained for the duration of the request. This allows for a reliable transmission, as the connection can be used to ensure that the packets all get to the right place. A TCP connection allows the two computers to remain in constant communication to ensure that the data is sent at an acceptable speed, and that any lost data is re-sent. With UDP, the opposite is true; packets of data are essentially thrown at the receiving computer -- if it can't keep up then that's its problem (this is why a video transmission over something like Skype can be pixelated if the connection is bad). What this means is that TCP would usually be chosen for situations where accuracy is favoured over speed (e.g. file transfer, or loading a webpage), and UDP would be used in situations where speed is more important (e.g. video streaming).  </p> <p>With a protocol selected, the transport layer then divides the transmission up into bite-sized pieces (over TCP these are called segments, over UDP they're called datagrams), which makes it easier to transmit the message successfully.  </p> <p>Layer 3 -- Network:  </p> <p>The network layer is responsible for locating the destination of your request. For example, the Internet is a huge network; when you want to request information from a webpage, it's the network layer that takes the IP address for the page and figures out the best route to take. At this stage we're working with what is referred to as Logical addressing (i.e. IP addresses) which are still software controlled. Logical addresses are used to provide order to networks, categorising them and allowing us to properly sort them. Currently the most common form of logical addressing is the IPV4 format, which you'll likely already be familiar with (i.e 192.168.1.1 is a common address for a home router).  </p> <p>Layer 2 -- Data Link:  </p> <p>The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (that includes the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical (MAC) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address to identify it.  </p> <p>MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.  </p> <p>Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.  </p> <p>The data link layer also serves an important function when it receives data, as it checks the received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted during transmission, which could well happen when the data is transmitted by layer 1: the physical layer.  </p> <p>Layer 1 -- Physical:  </p> <p>The physical layer is right down to the hardware of the computer. This is where the electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. It's the job of the physical layer to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals and transmit them across the network, as well as receiving incoming signals and converting them back into binary data.</p>"},{"location":"Certifications%20and%20courses/CompTia%20Network%2B%20Course/OSI%20%26%20TCP-IP%20Model/Application%20Layer/Application%20Layer-%20Layer%207/","title":"Application Layer  Layer 7","text":"<p>Application Layer- Layer 7 Layer with the most intelligence vs. other layers  </p> <p>Protocols that drive the applications with which users interface Protocols have direct access to your data  </p> <p>Certificate services - used to provide authentication for individuals or systems Non-repudiation, application integration, deep packet inspecrtion  </p> <p>Proxy servers - high end deep packet inspection devices give us a really good understanding and inspection of content and traffic of information  </p> <p>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) - specific to web traffic but provides protection and focuses on [[HTTP]] Good protection against Web attacks  </p> <p>Different protocols that manage how applications are allowed to send and receive over the network.

It defines the specific standard to which the physical components must comply to. The most commonly used protocols include the following, IEEE.802.11, IEEE.802.3 and several others.  </li> <li>Data link: The Data link layer provides communication between directly connected devices. It also provides error handling for the OSI model's physical layer. It consists of two sub-layers, Media Access Control (MAC) and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layers. Most switches operate on the Data link layer or Layer 2 for communication, but there are exceptions where switches can also work on Layer 3 and are referred to as a Layer 3 switch where routing capabilities are required.  </li> <li>Network: Routers function on the Network layer. This layer is responsible for forwarding packets to specific routes on the network. This layer analyses the packets received and determines if it has reached its destination and then passes it to the Transport layer. If it is not the final destination, it will pass it to the Data link layer until it reaches its final destination. The Network layer is also responsible for updating routing tables.  </li> <li>Transport: The Transport layer\u2019s function is to deliver data across network connections. The most commonly used protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Different protocols will have different functionalities when transporting data across the network. For example, error checking is done using the TCP protocol.  </li> <li>Session: The OSI model's Session layer manages the flow and sequence of different network connections. This ensures the possibility for dynamic concurrent connections.  </li> <li>Presentation: The simplest part of the OSI model is the Presentation layer, as it handles the processing and converting of the data, for example, encryption and decryption, to facilitate the support for the Application layer.  </li> <li>Application: The final layer in the OSI model, the Application layer, provides network services to the application. These services include protocols that integrate into the application; for example, the [[HTTP]] protocol is used to deliver data to a web browser to display a user's web page.  </li> </ol> <p>![[3 1.png]]</p> <p>[[https]]://sites.google.com/site/osimodellayers/layer-3---network [[https]]://community.cisco.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/34062i95AA8ACC6BD9290D/ </p> <p>OSI TCP/IP - Comes from DoD (Department of Defense) 1 Physical Please Network Never 2 Data Link Do Network 3 Network Not Internet Ingest 4 Transport Throw Transport Toxic 5 Session Sausage Application Apples 6 Presentation Pizza Application 7 Application Away Application  </p> <p></p> <p>[[http]]://www.gocertify.com/quizzes/osi/ </p> <p>Physical Layer- Layer 1 What we can touch, measure and see Uses logical addresses to route data  PDU/Protocol Data Unit - Bit / 1, 0 This layer converts packets from the data link layer into electrical signals Cables NIC - Network Interface Card  Ethernet settings Network and Sharing Center Change adapter settings Network Connections Right click Ethernet - Properties - Configure Details Property - Hardware IDs Is Connected If true - Physical connection looks good  </p> <p>Data Link - Layer 2 Provides point to point connectivity within our network Ex - packets to a switch,  PDU/Protocol Data Unit - frame- Segment of data with beginning and end The Data Link layer is composed of two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) lower sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) upper sublayer. Components/protocols relevant to the Data Link layer include driver details, MAC filtering, and ARP tables. Responsible for framing, error detection and physical addressing A MAC address is a 12 digit hexadecimal number, which is a physical address of the network components. Switches operate at this level and maps to MAC address EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) - IPv6 global unicast Multi-layer switches operate at Data-link layer 2 and Network layer 3 layers Hub operate at this level - pass info to everyone on network Bridges operate at this level - point to point  Driver Ethernet settings Network and Sharing Center Change adapter settings Network Connections Right click Ethernet - Properties - Configure Driver Driver Details - Make \u00a0the LLC sublayer is implemented in the driver of the interface.

Handshake, initiation, maintaining, who talks when This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communications between applications located on different devices The session layer provides mechanism to open, close and manage communication session between end-user applications. Communication sessions consist of requests and responses between applications. NFS/Network File system Presentation Layer- Formats data so it can be sent over a network, standardized or encrypted, or when received are formatting it so we can read it/put on computer and understand it Protocols - referring to presenting file types to the user , audio, visual, text etc  The presentation layer is responsible for formatting and delivering information to the application for further processing or display. It relieves the application layer of concern regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems. Encryption device operates at this level - Formats data  Examples of these layers functioning within the [[Windows]] environment include the use of NetBIOS names for the Session layer and character code translation such as from ASCII to EDCDIC and back.  For the most part these functionalities cannot be directly viewed within a [[Windows]] environment as most [[Windows]] network components are structured around the TCP/IP model and as such, these layers are included within the Application layer.

All these are network applications and services that require this process to run.  This process runs just below the network-aware applications such as web browsers, email clients, Remote Desktop clients, and other such software packages.

May contain information about recent traffic flows to systems outside of the corporate network. HIPS would not commonly alert on the modification of a specific file. ## Embedded system An embedded system usually does not provide access to the OS and may not even provide a method of upgrading the system firmware. ## End of life A device at it's end of life is no longer supported by the vendor. ## Pulping Pulping places papers into a large washing tank to remove the ink, and the paper is broken down into pulp and recycled. The information on the paper is not recoverable after pulping ## Degaussing Degaussing removes the electromagnetic field of storage media and electronics ## Host-based firewall logs Host-based firewall will allow or disallow incoming or outgoing application traffic. ## UTM A UTM / Unified Threat management appliance is commonly located in the core of the network. It would have a web security gateway, URL filter, content inspection, Malware inspection, spam filter, CSU, DSU, Router, Switch, Firewall, IDS, IPS, Bandwidth Shaper, and VPN endpoint. ## NetFlow logs NetFlow information can provide a summary of network traffic, application usage and details of network conversations. The NetFlow logs will show all conversations from this device to any others in the network. ## Email Header An email header contains information of email servers used to transfer the message and security signatures to verify the sender. ## Incident response Process Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons learned ## Preparation Communication methods, Incident handling hardware and software, IR resources, Incident mitigation software, and policies needed for incident handling ## Identification Detect and determine the nature of the incident. Gather and analyze data to confirm the incident ## Containment Short term containment. Immediately stop the spread of the incident- isolate affected systems. ## Eradication Identify the root cause of the incident. Remove malware, close vulnerabilities, and eliminate the threat ## Recovery Restore and validate system functionality. Monitor systems to ensure they return to normal operations without further incidents. ## Lessons learned Once the event is over, it's useful to revisit the process to learn and improve for next time. A post-incident meeting can help the incident response participants discuss the phases of the incident that went well and which processes can be improved for future events ## Disaster Recovery Plan A disaster recovery plan is a comprehensive set of processes to to follow for large-scale outages that affect the organization.  Natural disasters, technology failures, and human-created disasters would be reasons to implement a disaster recovery plan ## Stakeholder management Stakeholder management describers the relationship that IT has with their customers. Although stakeholder management is an important ongoing process, the priority after a major event is to start the disaster recovery process ## Communication plan A communication plan is a list of everyone who needs to be contacted during an incident. The communication plan will be important documentation after a disaster recovery process has started. ## Retention policies Retention policies specify the type and amount of data that must be backed up  and stored. These policies are often self-imposed or part of a larger set of rules and regulations ## Rootkit A rootkit traditionally modifies core system files and becomes effectively invisible to the rest of the operating system. The modification of system files and specialized kernal-level drivers are common rootkit techniques ## Bot A bot is relatively active malware that can usually be seen in a process list and by examining network communication. Botnet participants can often be identified using traditional anti-malware software ## Ransomware Ransomware makes itself quite visible on your system, and it usually presents warning messages and information on how to remove the ransomware from the system ## Keylogger A keylogger is a utility that captures keyboard and mouse input and sends that information to another device. This usually means that the keylogger has a visible component in the list of processes and traffic that can be seen on the

As an example, the header added by the Network Layer would include things like the source and destination IP addresses, and the header added by the Transport Layer would include (amongst other things) information specific to the protocol being used.\u00a0The data link layer also adds a piece on at the end of the transmission, which is used to verify that the data has not been corrupted on transmission; this also has the added bonus of increased security, as the data can't be intercepted and tampered with without breaking the trailer.\u00a0This whole process is referred to as encapsulation; the process by which data can be sent from one computer to another.  Notice that the encapsulated data is given a different name at different steps of the process. In layers 7,6 and 5, the data is simply referred to as data. In the transport layer the encapsulated data is referred to as a segment or a datagram (depending on whether TCP or UDP has been selected as a transmission protocol). At the Network Layer, the data is referred to as a packet. When the packet gets passed down to the Data Link layer it becomes a frame, and by the time it's transmitted across a network the frame has been broken down into bits. When the message is received by the second computer, it reverses the process -- starting at the physical layer and working up until it reaches the application layer, stripping off the added information as it goes. This is referred to as\u00a0de-encapsulation. As such you can think of the layers of the OSI model as existing inside every computer with network capabilities. Whilst it's not actually as clear cut in practice, computers all follow the same process of encapsulation to send data and de-encapsulation upon receiving it. The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation are very important -- not least because of their practical use, but also because they give us a standardised method for sending data. This means that all transmissions will consistently follow the same methodology, allowing any network enabled device to send a request to any other reachable device and be sure that it will be understood -- regardless of whether they are from the same manufacturer; use the same operating system; or any other factors.</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/OSI%20model%20overview/","title":"OSI model overview","text":"<p>sentation layer, it looks to see if it can set up a connection with the other computer across the network. If it can't then it sends back an error and the process goes no further. If a session can\u00a0be established then it's the job of the session layer to maintain it, as well as co-operate with the session layer of the remote computer in order to synchronise communications. The session layer is particularly important as the session that it creates is unique to the communication in question. This is what allows you to make multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all the data getting mixed up (think about opening two tabs in a web browser at the same time)! When the session layer has successfully logged a connection between the host and remote computer the data is passed down to Layer 4: the transport Layer. Layer 4 -- Transport: The transport layer is a very interesting layer that serves numerous important functions. Its first purpose is to choose the protocol over which the data is to be transmitted. The two most common protocols in the transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol); with TCP the transmission is connection-based which means that a connection between the computers is established and maintained for the duration of the request. This allows for a reliable transmission, as the connection can be used to ensure that the packets all\u00a0get to the right place. A TCP connection allows the two computers to remain in constant communication to ensure that the data is sent at an acceptable speed, and that any lost data is re-sent. With UDP, the opposite is true; packets of data are essentially thrown at the receiving computer -- if it can't keep up then that's its problem (this is why a video transmission over something like Skype can be pixelated if the connection is bad). What this means is that TCP would usually be chosen for situations where accuracy is favoured over speed (e.g. file transfer, or loading a webpage), and UDP would be used in situations where speed is more important (e.g. video streaming). With a protocol selected, the transport layer then divides the transmission up into bite-sized pieces (over TCP these are called segments, over UDP they're called datagrams), which makes it easier to transmit the message successfully.\u00a0 Layer 3 -- Network: The network layer is responsible for locating the destination of your request. For example, the Internet is a huge network; when you want to request information from a webpage, it's the network layer that takes the IP address for the page and figures out the best route to take. At this stage we're working with what is referred to as Logical addressing (i.e. IP addresses) which are still software controlled. Logical addresses are used to provide order to networks, categorising them and allowing us to properly sort them. Currently the most common form of logical addressing is the IPV4 format, which you'll likely already be familiar with (i.e 192.168.1.1 is a common address for a home router). Layer 2 -- Data Link: The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (that includes the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical (MAC) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address to identify it. MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.  </p> <p>Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission. The data link layer also serves an important function when it receives data, as it checks the received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted during transmission, which could well happen when the data is transmitted by layer 1: the physical layer. Layer 1 -- Physical: The physical layer is right down to the hardware of the computer. This is where the electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. It's the job of the physical layer to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals and transmit them across the network, as well as receiving incoming signals and converting them back into binary data.</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/OSI%20workshop/","title":"OSI workshop","text":"<p>[[https]]://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOH2J2Hw=/</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/TCP-IP%20model/","title":"TCP IP model","text":"<p>The TCP/IP model is, in many ways, very similar to the OSI model. It's a few years older, and serves as the basis for real-world networking.\u00a0The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet and Network Interface. Between them, these cover the same range of functions as the seven layers of the OSI Model. Note: Some recent sources split the TCP/IP model into five layers -- breaking the Network Interface layer into Data Link and Physical layers (as with the OSI model). This is accepted and well-known; however, it is not officially defined (unlike the original four layers which are defined in RFC1122). It's up to you which version you use -- both are generally considered valid. </p> <p>You would be justified in asking why we bother with the OSI model if it's not actually used for anything in the real-world. The answer to that question is quite simply that the OSI model (due to being less condensed and more rigid than the TCP/IP model) tends to be easier for learning the initial theory of networking.  </p> <p>The two models match up something like this:  The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation work in exactly the same way with the TCP/IP model as they do with the OSI model. At each layer of the TCP/IP model a header is added during encapsulation, and removed during de-encapsulation. Now let's get down to the practical side of things. A layered model is great as a visual aid -- it shows us the general process of how data can be encapsulated and sent across a network, but how does it actually happen? When we talk about TCP/IP, it's all well and good to think about a table with four layers in it, but we're actually talking about a suite of protocols -- sets of rules that define how an action is to be carried out. TCP/IP takes its name from the two most important of these: the Transmission Control Protocol (which we touched upon earlier in the OSI model) that controls the flow of data between two endpoints, and the Internet Protocol, which controls how packets are addressed and sent. There are many more protocols that make up the TCP/IP suite; we will cover some of these in later tasks. For now though, let's talk about TCP. As mentioned earlier, TCP is a connection-based protocol. In other words, before you send any data via TCP, you must first form a stable connection between the two computers. The process of forming this connection is called the three-way handshake. When you attempt to make a connection, your computer first sends a special request to the remote server indicating that it wants to initialise a connection. This request contains something called a SYN (short for synchronise) bit, which essentially makes first contact in starting the connection process. The server will then respond with a packet containing the SYN bit, as well as another \"acknowledgement\" bit, called ACK. Finally, your computer will send a packet that contains the ACK bit by itself, confirming that the connection has been setup successfully. With the three-way handshake successfully completed, data can be reliably transmitted between the two computers. Any data that is lost or corrupted on transmission is re-sent, thus leading to a connection which appears to be lossless. </p> <p> (Credit Kieran Smith, Abertay University) We're not going to go into exactly how\u00a0this works on a step-to-step level -- not in this room at any rate. It is sufficient to know that the three-way handshake must be carried out before a connection can be established using TCP. History: It's important to understand exactly why\u00a0the TCP/IP and OSI models were originally created. To begin with there was no standardisation -- different manufacturers followed their own methodologies, and consequently systems made by different manufacturers were completely incompatible when it came to networking. The TCP/IP model was introduced by the American DoD in 1982 to provide a standard -- something for all of the different manufacturers to follow. This sorted out the inconsistency problems. Later the OSI model was also introduced by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO); however, it's mainly used as a more comprehensive guide for learning, as the TCP/IP model is still the standard upon which modern networking is based.</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/port%20forwarding/","title":"Port forwarding","text":"<p>[[SSH]] [port forwarding](&lt;./port forwarding.md&gt;) on [[Linux]]</p> <pre><code>ssh -L 8080:10.10.43.83:80 boost@192.168.0.50 -fN\n</code></pre> <p>The syntax is LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT What the [[SSH]] command is doing is: Make a connection to my local port 8080 to the ip machine on port 80 (where the web server is running).

Ever wondered how a URL gets converted into an IP address that your computer can understand? The answer is a TCP/IP protocol called [[DNS]] (Domain Name System). At the most basic level, [[DNS]] allows us to ask a special server to give us the IP address of the website we're trying to access. For example, if we made a request to www.google.com, our computer would first send a request to a special [[DNS]] server (which your computer already knows how to find). The server would then go looking for the IP address for Google and send it back to us. Our computer could then send the request to the IP of the Google server. Let's break this down a bit. You make a request to a website. The first thing that your computer does is check its local cache to see if it's already got an IP address stored for the website; if it does, great. If not, it goes to the next stage of the process. Assuming the address hasn't already been found, your computer will then send a request to what's known as a recursive\u00a0[[DNS]] server. These will automatically be known to the router on your network. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers, but companies such as Google and OpenDNS also control recursive servers. This is how your computer automatically knows where to send the request for information: details for a recursive [[DNS]] server are stored in your router. This server will also maintain a cache of results for popular domains; however, if the website you've requested isn't stored in the cache, the recursive server will pass the request on to a root name\u00a0server. Before 2004 there were precisely 13 root name [[DNS]] servers in the world. These days there are many more; however, they are still accessible using the same 13 IP addresses assigned to the original servers (balanced so that you get the closest server when you make a request). The root name servers essentially keep track of the [[DNS]] servers in the next level down, choosing an appropriate one to redirect your request to. These lower level servers are called Top-Level Domain\u00a0servers. Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for [[tryhackme]].com your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled <code>.com</code> domains. If you were searching for bbc.co.uk your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handles\u00a0<code>.co.uk</code>\u00a0domains. As with root name servers, TLD servers keep track of the next level down: Authoritative name servers. When a TLD server receives your request for information, the server passes it down to an appropriate Authoritative name server. Authoritative name servers are used to store [[DNS]] records for domains directly. In other words, every domain in the world will have its [[DNS]] records stored on an Authoritative name server somewhere or another; they are the source of the information. When your request reaches the authoritative name server for the domain you're querying, it will send the relevant information back to you, allowing your computer to connect to the IP address behind the domain you requested. When you visit a website in your web browser this all happens automatically, but we can also do it manually with a tool called <code>dig</code> . Like ping and traceroute, dig should be installed automatically on [[Linux]] systems. Dig allows us to manually query recursive [[DNS]] servers of our choice for information about domains: <code>dig &lt;domain&gt; @&lt;dns-server-ip&gt;</code> It is a very useful tool for network troubleshooting.  This is a lot\u00a0of information. We're currently most interested in the <code>ANSWER</code>\u00a0section for this room; however, taking the time to learn what the rest of this means is a very good idea. In summary, that information is telling us that we sent it one query and successfully (i.e. No Errors) received one full answer -- which, as expected, contains the IP address for the domain name that we queried. Another interesting piece of information that dig gives us is the TTL (Time To Live) of the queried [[DNS]] record. As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache. The TTL of the record tells your computer when to stop considering the record as being valid -- i.e. when it should request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy. The TTL can be found in the second column of the answer section:  It's important to remember that TTL (in the context of [[DNS]] caching) is measured in seconds, so the record in the example will expire in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.

Can you imagine how it would feel to remember the IP address of every website you want to visit? Horrible thought. Fortunately, we've got domains.

Domains are leased out by companies called Domain Registrars. If you want a domain, you go and register with a registrar, then lease the domain for a certain length of time.\u00a0 Enter Whois. Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to. In Europe personal details are redacted;\u00a0however, elsewhere you can potentially get a great deal of information from a whois search.

For the rest of the room we're going to be taking a look at some of the command line networking tools that we can use in practical applications. Many of these tools do work on other operating systems, but for the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume that you're running [[Linux]] for the rest of this room. The first tool that we're going to look at will be the <code>ping</code> command. The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible. Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly. Ping works using the ICMP protocol, which is one of the slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocols that were mentioned earlier. The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI Model, and thus the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. The basic syntax for ping is <code>ping &lt;target&gt;</code>. In this example we are using ping to test whether a network connection to Google is possible: ![image]]([[https]]://muirlandoracle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-14.png) Notice that the ping command actually returned the IP address for the Google server that it connected to, rather than the URL that was requested. This is a handy secondary application for ping, as it can be used to determine the IP address of the server hosting a website. One of the big advantages of ping is that it's pretty much ubiquitous to any network enabled device. All operating systems support it out of the box, and even most embedded devices can use ping!  </p> <p>Have a go at the following questions. Any questions about syntax can be answered using the man page for ping (<code>man ping</code> on [[Linux]]).</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Networking%20Tools/traceroute/","title":"Traceroute","text":"<p>The logical follow-up to the ping command is 'traceroute'. Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.  </p> <p>The internet is made up of many, many different servers and end-points, all networked up to each other. This means that, in order to get to the content you actually want, you first need to go through a bunch of other servers. Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections -- it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested. The basic syntax for traceroute on [[Linux]] is this: <code>traceroute &lt;destination&gt;</code> By default, the [[Windows]] traceroute utility (<code>tracert</code>) operates using the same ICMP protocol that ping utilises, and the Unix equivalent operates over UDP. This can be altered with switches in both instances.  You can see that it took 13 hops to get from my router (<code>_gateway</code>) to the Google server at 216.58.205.46 Now it's your turn. As with before, all questions about switches can be answered with the man page for traceroute (<code>man traceroute</code>).</p>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/","title":"Cisco switch commands","text":""},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/#initial-mode-user-exec-mode","title":"Initial Mode: User EXEC Mode","text":"<ul> <li>Switch&gt;</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/#privileged-exec-mode","title":"Privileged EXEC mode","text":"<ul> <li>Switch&gt; <code>enable</code></li> <li>Switch#</li> <li>S1# <code>wr</code><ul> <li>wr is shorthand for <code>write memory</code>, which saves the running config to NVRAM so it persists after reboot</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/#global-configuration-mode","title":"Global Configuration Mode","text":"<ul> <li>Switch# <code>configure terminal</code> or <code>conf t</code></li> <li>Switch(config)# <code>hostname S1</code> <ul> <li>changes hostname of switch</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config)# <code>enable password password</code><ul> <li>enables password for all lines</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config)# <code>enable secret class</code><ul> <li>creates password for global configuration mode</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config)# <code>service password-encryption</code><ul> <li>encrypts plaintext passwords</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config)# <code>banner motd \"Your mom\"</code><ul> <li>creates or changes message of the day</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/#line-configuration-mode","title":"Line configuration Mode","text":"<ul> <li>S1(config)# <code>line console 0</code><ul> <li>configures the console line (physical access via cable)</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config-line)# <code>password cisco</code><ul> <li>sets the password for console line 0</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config-line)# <code>login</code><ul> <li>enables password checking at login</li> </ul> </li> <li>S1(config-line)# <code>exit</code><ul> <li>exits back to Global Config</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Introductory%20Networking/Packet%20Tracer/Cisco%20switch%20commands/#configure-switch-management-interface","title":"Configure Switch Management Interface","text":"<ul> <li>S1# <code>configure terminal</code> or <code>conf t</code></li> <li>Enter configuration commands, one per line.

Generally, at work, I will use some sort of naming scheme for this group, such as the team who has access and what level of access or maybe the service that this group has access to (usually more for the sudoers stuff). Something like hackers_rwx for your hacking users or hacker_ro for read only (rx). However you want to name it. Make it meaningful. rwx = the level of access you want to assign ,d = set the default ACLs for new files created within. When you run this command without the default, then it only applies to files in the directory now. Same applies with running chown root:root /dir. You only apply them once and any new files do not inherit these changes. Next part repeats the previous, but these are the defaults you want for new files. /DIR = wherever you want to assign permissions.</p> <p>Do not use on CHOWN and CHMOD for additional permissions!  </p> <p>sudo setfacl -Rm g:GROUPNAME:rwx,d:g:GROUPNAME:rwx /DIR (replace the groupname with a group you have made specifically for access and DIR with the directory). You can then assign recursive permissions on a directory without screwing with the owners. It also sets the default ACLs for newly created files.

That means that \\w will match every single character in test_file.  </p> <p>Often we want a pattern that matches many characters of a single type in a row, and we can do that with repetitions. For example, {2} is used to match the preceding character (or metacharacter, or charset) two times in a row. That means that z{2} will match exactly zz.  </p> <p>Here's a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:  </p> <p>{12} - exactly 12 times. {1,5} - 1 to 5 times. {2,} - 2 or more times. * - 0 or more times. + - 1 or more times.  </p> <p>Sometimes it's very useful to specify that we want to search by a certain pattern in the beginning or the end of a line. We do that with these characters: ^ - starts with $ - ends with  </p> <p>So for example, if you want to search for a line that starts with abc, you can use ^abc. If you want to search for a line that ends with xyz, you can use xyz$.  </p> <p>Note: The ^ hat symbol is used to exclude a charset when enclosed in [square brackets], but when it is not, it is used to specify the beginning of a word.  </p> <p>You can also define groups by enclosing a pattern in (parentheses). This function can be used for many ways that are not in the scope of this tutorial. We will use it to define an either/ or pattern, and also to repeat patterns. To say \"or\" in Regex, we use the | pipe.  </p> <p>For an \"either/or\" pattern example, the pattern during the (day|night) will match both of these sentences: during the day and during the night. For a repetition example, the pattern (no){5} will match the sentence nonononono.</p>"},{"location":"Linux/TryHackMe/Shell%20Operators/","title":"Shell Operators","text":"<p>&amp; - allows you to run

The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.  Payload An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access tot the target system, read confidential information) we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.</p> <p>Auxillary Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here. Encoders Will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them. - signature-based anti-virus and security solutions have a DB of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks Evasion While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.  Exploits organized by target systems NOPS No Operation, do nothing literally - They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family they are represented with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes. Payloads code that will run on the target system - Singles Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc) that do not need to download and additional component to run - Stagers Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. \"Staged Payloads\" will first upload a stager on the target then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once - Stages  Download by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads. - Post Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.</p> <p>start metasploit <pre><code>~$ msfconsole\n</code></pre></p> <p>common commands <pre><code># view sessions \n~$ sessions  \n\n# upgrade the last opened session to Meterpreter \n~$ sessions -u -1  \n\n# interact with a session \n~$ sessions -i session_id  \n\n# Background the currently interactive session, and go back to the Metasploit prompt \n~$ background\n\n# To search for a module, use the \u2018search\u2019 command:\n~$msf6 &gt; search laravel\n\n# Load a module with the \u2018use\u2019 command\n~$ msf6 &gt; use multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce\n\n# view the information about the module, including the module options, description, CVE details, etc\n~$ msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) &gt; inf0\n\n# View the available options to set\n~$ show options\n\n# Set the target host and logging\n~$ set rhost 10.10.163.96\n~$ set verbose true\n\n# Set the payload listening address; this is the IP address of the host running Metasploit\n~$ set lhost LISTEN_IP\n\n# show options again\n~$ show options\n\n# Run or check the module\n~$ check\n~$ run\n</code></pre></p> <p>Meterpreter common commands <pre><code># Get information about the remote system, such as OS\n~$ sysinfo\n# Upload a file or directory \n~$ upload local_file.txt  \n# Display interfaces \n~$ ipconfig  \n# Resolve a set of host names on the target to IP addresses - useful for pivoting resolve\n~$ remote_service1 remote_service2\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/mitmproxy/","title":"Mitmproxy","text":"<p>[[https]]://mitmproxy.org/</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/netdiscover/","title":"Netdiscover","text":"<p>The following command will scan a network for devices connected to it. </p> <pre><code>$ sudo netdiscover -i enp0s3 -r 192.168.0.0/24\n\n Currently scanning: 192.168.0.0/24   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts\n\n 24 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 24 hosts.

By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.  </p> <p>How does NFS work?  </p> <p>Computer network - Vector stencils library | Computers ...  </p> <p>We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: [[https]]://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html </p> <p>First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.  </p> <p>The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.  </p> <p>If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:  </p> <p>The file handle The name of the file to be accessed The user's, user ID The user's group ID  </p> <p>These are used in determining access rights to the specified file.

If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections.  </p> <p>More Details:  </p> <p>You can find more details on the technical function, and implementation of, docs/Pentesting Notes/Attacks/Hacking Tools/Network Exploitation/Network Services/ftp on the Internet Engineering Task Force website: [[https]]://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt.

If you get stuck using any tool- you can always use \"tool [-h / -help / --help]\" to find out more about it's function and syntax. Equally, man pages are extremely useful for this purpose. They can be reached using \"man [tool]\".

This can be exploited because you can issue cwd commands before authentication, and if there's a home directory- there is more than likely a user account to go with it.

Your typical [[Windows]] host will, with its default firewall, block all ICMP packets. This presents a problem: not only do we often use ping to manually establish the activity of a target, Nmap does the same thing by default. This means that Nmap will register a host with this firewall configuration as dead and not bother scanning it at all. So, we need a way to get around this configuration. Fortunately Nmap provides an option for this: <code>-Pn</code>, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block; however, it comes at the price of potentially taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port). It's worth noting that if you're already directly on the local network, Nmap can also use ARP requests to determine host activity. There are a variety of other switches which Nmap considers useful for firewall evasion. We will not go through these in detail, however, they can be found here. The following switches are of particular note: \u2022 <code>-f</code>:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS. \u2022 An alternative to <code>-f</code>, but providing more control over the size of the packets: <code>--mtu &lt;number&gt;</code>, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8. \u2022 <code>--scan-delay &lt;time&gt;ms</code>:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place. \u2022 <code>--badsum</code>:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/ICMP%20Network%20Scanning/","title":"ICMP Network Scanning","text":"<p>On first connection to a target network in a black box assignment, our first objective is to obtain a \"map\" of the network structure -- or, in other words, we want to see which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which do not.  </p> <p>One way to do this is by using Nmap to perform a so called \"ping sweep\". This is exactly as the name suggests: Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network.

NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is. There are many categories available. Some useful categories include: \u2022 <code>safe</code>:- Won't affect the target \u2022 <code>intrusive</code>:- Not safe: likely to affect the target- very bad idea to run in a production environment  </p> <p>\u2022 <code>vuln</code>:- Scan for vulnerabilities \u2022 <code>exploit</code>:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability \u2022 <code>auth</code>:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an docs/Pentesting Notes/Attacks/Hacking Tools/Network Exploitation/Network Services/ftp server anonymously) \u2022 <code>brute</code>:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services \u2022 <code>discovery</code>:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an [[SNMP]] server).  </p> <p>A more exhaustive list can be found here.  </p> <p>In Task 3 we looked very briefly at the <code>--script</code> switch for activating NSE scripts from the <code>vuln</code> category using <code>--script=vuln</code>. It should come as no surprise that the other categories work in exactly the same way. If the command <code>--script=safe</code> is run, then any applicable safe scripts will be run against the target (Note: only scripts which target an active service will be activated). To run a specific script, we would use <code>--script=&lt;script-name&gt;</code> , e.g. <code>--script=http-fileupload-exploiter</code>. Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously in this fashion by separating them by a comma. For example: <code>--script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares</code>. Some scripts require arguments (for example, credentials, if they're exploiting an authenticated vulnerability). These can be given with the <code>--script-args</code> Nmap switch. An example of this would be with the <code>http-put</code> script (used to upload files using the PUT method). This takes two arguments: the URL to upload the file to, and the file's location on disk.\u00a0 For example: <code>nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'</code> Note that the arguments are separated by commas, and connected to the corresponding script with periods (i.e.\u00a0 <code>&lt;script-name&gt;.&lt;argument&gt;</code>). A full list of scripts and their corresponding arguments (along with example use cases) can be found here. Nmap scripts come with built-in help menus, which can be accessed using <code>nmap --script-help &lt;script-name&gt;</code>. This tends not to be as extensive as in the link given above, however, it can still be useful when working locally.  </p> <p>how to find these scripts. We have two options for this, which should ideally be used in conjunction with each other. The first is the page on the [[Nmap]] website (mentioned in the previous task) which contains a list of all official scripts. The second is the local storage on your attacking machine. Nmap stores its scripts on [[Linux]] at <code>/usr/share/nmap/scripts</code>. All of the NSE scripts are stored in this directory by default -- this is where Nmap looks for scripts when you specify them. There are two ways to search for installed scripts. One is by using the <code>/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db</code> file. Despite the extension, this isn't actually a database so much as a formatted text file containing filenames and categories for each available script. </p> <p>Nmap uses this file to keep track of (and utilise) scripts for the scripting engine; however, we can also grep through it to look for scripts. For example: <code>grep \"ftp\" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db</code>.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The second way to search for scripts is quite simply to use the <code>ls</code> command. For example, we could get the same results as in the previous screenshot by using <code>ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*</code>: </p> <p>Note the use of asterisks (<code>*</code>) on either side of the search term The same techniques can also be used to search for categories of script. For example: <code>grep \"safe\" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db</code> </p> <p> </p> <p>Installing New Scripts We mentioned previously that the Nmap website contains a list of scripts, so, what happens if one of these is missing in the <code>scripts</code> directory locally? A standard <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install nmap</code> should fix this; however, it's also possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap (<code>sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/&lt;script-name&gt;.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/&lt;script-name&gt;.nse</code>). This must then be followed up with <code>nmap --script-updatedb</code>, which updates the <code>script.db</code> file to contain the newly downloaded script. It's worth noting that you would require the same \"updatedb\" command if you were to make your own NSE script and add it into Nmap -- a more than manageable task with some basic knowledge of Lua!</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/NULL%2C%20FIN%2C%20Xmas/","title":"NULL, FIN, Xmas","text":"<p>NULL, FIN and Xmas TCP port scans are less commonly used than any of the others we've covered already, so we will not go into a huge amount of depth here. All three are interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN \"stealth\" scan. Beginning with NULL scans: \u2022 As the name suggests, NULL scans (<code>-sN</code>) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed. </p> <p>\u2022 FIN scans (<code>-sF</code>) work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed. </p> <p>\u2022 As with the other two scans in this class, Xmas scans (<code>-sX</code>) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark. </p> <p>The expected response for open ports with these scans is also identical, and is very similar to that of a UDP scan. If the port is open then there is no response to the malformed packet. Unfortunately (as with open UDP ports), that is also an expected behaviour if the port is protected by a firewall, so NULL, FIN and Xmas scans will only ever identify ports as being open|filtered, closed, or filtered. If a port is identified as filtered with one of these scans then it is usually because the target has responded with an ICMP unreachable packet.  </p> <p>It's also worth noting that while RFC 793 mandates that network hosts respond to malformed packets with a RST TCP packet for closed ports, and don't respond at all for open ports; this is not always the case in practice. In particular Microsoft [[Windows]] (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a RST to any malformed TCP packet -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not. This results in all ports showing up as being closed.  </p> <p>That said, the goal here is, of course, firewall evasion. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set (thus blocking new connection initiation requests). By sending requests which do not contain the SYN flag, we effectively bypass this kind of firewall. Whilst this is good in theory, most modern IDS solutions are savvy to these scan types, so don't rely on them to be 100% effective when dealing with modern systems.</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/SYN%20Scans/","title":"SYN Scans","text":"<p>As with TCP scans, SYN scans (<code>-sS</code>) are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as \"Half-open\" scans, or \"Stealth\" scans.  </p> <p>Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request). In other words, the sequence for scanning an open port looks like this: </p> <p>This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers: \u2022 It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as \"stealth\" scans. \u2022 SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy. \u2022 Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.  </p> <p>There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely: \u25c7 They require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in [[Linux]]. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default. \u25c7 Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.  </p> <p>All in all, the pros outweigh the cons. For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task. When using a SYN scan to identify closed and filtered ports, the exact same rules as with a TCP Connect scan apply. If a port is closed then the server responds with a RST TCP packet. If the port is filtered by a firewall then the TCP SYN packet is either dropped, or spoofed with a TCP reset. In this regard, the two scans are identical: the big difference is in how they handle open ports.

If this term is new to you then completing Introductory Networking before continuing would be advisable. As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.  This is one of the fundamental principles of TCP/IP networking, but how does it relate to Nmap? Well, as the name suggests, a TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn. In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives. For example, if a port is closed, RFC 793 states that: \"... If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent in response to any incoming segment except another reset.\u00a0 In particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected by this means.\" In other words, if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed. ![image]]([[https]]://i.imgur.com/vUQL9SK.png) If, however, the request is sent to an open port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap then marks this port as being open (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set). This is all well and good, however, there is a third possibility. What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall? Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered. That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for [[Linux]], a simple version of the command would be as follows: <code>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset</code> This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/UDP%20Scans/","title":"UDP Scans","text":"<p>Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless. This means that, rather than initiating a connection with a back-and-forth \"handshake\", UDP connections rely on sending packets to a target port and essentially hoping that they make it. This makes UDP superb for connections which rely on speed over quality (e.g. video sharing), but the lack of acknowledgement makes UDP significantly more difficult (and much slower) to scan. The switch for an Nmap UDP scan is (<code>-sU</code>)  </p> <p>When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being <code>open|filtered</code>. In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very unusual), then the port is marked as open. More commonly there is no response, in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked open|filtered and Nmap moves on.  </p> <p>When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed ports, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.  </p> <p>Due to this difficulty in identifying whether a UDP port is actually open, UDP scans tend to be incredibly slow in comparison to the various TCP scans (in the region of 20 minutes to scan the first 1000 ports, with a good connection). For this reason it's usually good practice to run an Nmap scan with <code>--top-ports &lt;number&gt;</code> enabled. For example, scanning with\u00a0 <code>nmap -sU --top-ports 20 &lt;target&gt;</code>. Will scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports, resulting in a much more acceptable scan time. When scanning UDP ports, Nmap usually sends completely empty requests -- just raw UDP packets. That said, for ports which are usually occupied by well-known services, it will instead send a protocol-specific payload which is more likely to elicit a response from which a more accurate result can be drawn.</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/main/","title":"Main","text":"<p>When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have about a target system or network, the more options you have available. This makes it imperative that proper enumeration is carried out before any exploitation attempts are made. Say we have been given an IP (or multiple IP addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the \u201clandscape\u201d we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a [[Windows]] Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this \u201cmap\u201d of the landscape is something called port scanning. When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a \u201cport\u201d to receive the connection. \u00a0Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. For example, when you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. Equally, if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both [[HTTP]] and [[HTTPS]] versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. Network connections are made between two ports \u2013 an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server\u2019s port 443.  As in the previous example, the diagram shows what happens when you connect to numerous websites at the same time. Your computer opens up a different, high-numbered port (at random), which it uses for all its communications with the remote server. Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports. For example, a [[HTTP]] Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A [[HTTPS]] Webservice can be found on port 443. [[Windows]] NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445. It is important to note; however, that especially in a CTF setting, it is not unheard of for even these standard ports to be altered, making it even more imperative that we perform appropriate enumeration on the target. If we do not know which of these ports a server has open, then we do not have a hope of successfully attacking the target; thus, it is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways \u2013 usually using a tool called nmap, which is the focus of this room. Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan \u2013 the most common of these will be introduced in upcoming tasks; however, the basic theory is this: nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall). Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services are running on each port \u2013 either manually, or more commonly using nmap. So, why nmap? The short answer is that it's currently the industry standard for a reason: no other port scanning tool comes close to matching its functionality (although some newcomers are now matching it for speed). It is an extremely powerful tool \u2013 made even more powerful by its scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities, and in some cases even perform the exploit directly! Once again, this will be covered more in upcoming tasks.

It displays a high level of verbosity, useful for debugging or analyzing the scan results in detail. - : This is the IP address of the target host or network to be scanned, as explained before. - -oN scan_results.txt: This option specifies the output format as normal and saves the results to a file named scan_results.txt, similar to the previous explanation."},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/nmap%20cheatsheet/#beginner-concepts","title":"Beginner Concepts","text":""},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/nmap%20cheatsheet/#basic-scanning","title":"Basic Scanning","text":"<pre><code># Basic Scanning\nnmap &lt;target&gt;      # Scan a single target\nnmap &lt;target1&gt; &lt;target2&gt;  # Scan multiple targets\n\n# Scan Types\nnmap -sP &lt;target&gt;       # Ping scan (discover hosts)\nnmap -sS &lt;target&gt;       # TCP SYN scan\nnmap -sT &lt;target&gt;       # TCP connect scan\nnmap -sU &lt;target&gt;       # UDP scan\nnmap -sV &lt;target&gt;       # Version detection\n\n# Scan Options\nnmap -p &lt;port&gt; &lt;target&gt;     # Scan specific port(s)\nnmap -F &lt;target&gt;            # Fast scan (100 most common ports)\nnmap -T&lt;0-5&gt; &lt;target&gt;       # Timing template (0-5, higher is faster)\nnmap -A &lt;target&gt;            # Aggressive scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning)\n\n# Output Options\nnmap -oN output.txt &lt;target&gt;   # Output to normal format\nnmap -oX output.xml &lt;target&gt;   # Output to XML format\nnmap -oG output.grep &lt;target&gt;  # Output to grepable format\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/nmap%20cheatsheet/#intermediate-concepts","title":"Intermediate Concepts","text":"<pre><code># Scripting Engine\nnmap --script &lt;script&gt; &lt;target&gt;     # Run specific NSE script(s)\nnmap --script-help &lt;script&gt;         # Get help for NSE script\n\n# OS Detection\nnmap -O &lt;target&gt;            # Perform OS detection\n\n# Firewall Evasion\nnmap -f &lt;target&gt;            # Fragment packets\nnmap --mtu &lt;MTU&gt; &lt;target&gt;  # Specify MTU size\n\n# Timing and Performance\nnmap -T&lt;0-5&gt; &lt;target&gt;       # Timing template (0-5, higher is faster)\nnmap --max-rtt-timeout &lt;time&gt; &lt;target&gt;   # Maximum round trip time timeout\n\n# Scan Optimization\nnmap --min-parallelism &lt;num&gt; &lt;target&gt;    # Minimum parallelism level\nnmap --min-hostgroup &lt;num&gt; &lt;target&gt;      # Minimum number of hosts per group\n\n# Output Filtering\nnmap --open &lt;target&gt;        # Show only open ports\nnmap --closed &lt;target&gt;      # Show only closed ports\nnmap --host-timeout &lt;time&gt; &lt;target&gt;   # Host timeout value\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/nmap/","title":"Nmap","text":"<p>65535 ports on any network enabled computer 1024 well known ports</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap/nmap/#tcp-connect-scan-st","title":"TCP Connect Scan -sT","text":"<ul> <li>We are interested in learning whether the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection.

so we will get <code>'a'=(select 'a')</code> since a query normally returns more than 1 character lets make it return a simple string such as testabc like such <code>'a'=(select 'testabc')</code> , the problem here is that we only know what it contains if we can guess the exact output in the `'a' </p> <p>since this is inefficient we can limit the amount of guesses we need to do to a single

admin are <code>ad</code> <code>'d' =(SUBSTRING('admin',2,1))</code> evaluates to TRUE since the second character of admin is <code>d</code> as you can see we can brute-force a string now character by

And you'll see this returns an SQL error informing you of an error in your syntax. The fact that you've received this error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability. We can now exploit this vulnerability and use the error messages to learn more about the database structure.\u00a0  </p> <p>The first thing we need to do is return data to the browser without displaying an error message. Firstly we'll try the UNION operator so we can receive an extra result of our choosing. Try setting the mock browsers id parameter to:  </p> <p><code>1 UNION SELECT 1</code> </p> <p>This statement should produce an error message informing you that the UNION SELECT statement has a different number of columns than the original SELECT query. So let's try again but add another column:  </p> <p><code>1 UNION SELECT 1,2</code> </p> <p>Same error again, so let's repeat by adding another column:  </p> <p><code>1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3</code> </p> <p>Success, the error message has gone, and the article is being displayed, but now we want to display our data instead of the article. The article is being displayed because it takes the first returned result somewhere in the web site's code and shows that. To get around that, we need the first query to produce no results. This can simply be done by changing the article id from 1 to 0.  </p> <p><code>0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3</code> </p> <p>You'll now see the article is just made up of the result from the UNION select returning the column values 1, 2, and 3. We can start using these returned values to retrieve more useful information. First, we'll get the database name that we have access to:  </p> <p><code>0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()</code> </p> <p>You'll now see where the number 3 was previously displayed; it now shows the name of the database, which is\u00a0sqli_one.  </p> <p>Our next query will gather a list of tables that are in this database.  </p> <p><code>0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_one'</code> </p> <p>There are a couple of new things to learn in this query. Firstly, the method\u00a0group_concat()\u00a0gets the specified column (in our case, table_name) from multiple returned rows and puts it into one string separated by commas. The next thing is the\u00a0information_schema\u00a0database; every user of the database has access to this, and it contains information about all the databases and tables the user has access to. In this particular query, we're interested in listing all the tables in the\u00a0sqli_one\u00a0database, which is article and staff_users.\u00a0  </p> <p>As the first level aims to discover Martin's password, the staff_users table is what is of interest to us. We can utilise the information_schema database again to find the structure of this table using the below query.  </p> <p><code>0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users'</code> </p> <p>This is similar to the previous SQL query. However, the information we want to retrieve has changed from table_name to\u00a0column_name, the table we are querying in the information_schema database has changed from tables to\u00a0columns, and we're searching for any rows where the\u00a0table_name\u00a0column has a value of\u00a0staff_users.  </p> <p>The query results provide three columns for the staff_users table: id, password, and username. We can use the username and password columns for our following query to retrieve the user's information.  </p> <p><code>0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '&lt;br&gt;') FROM staff_users</code> </p> <p>Again we use the group_concat method to return all of the rows into one string and to make it easier to read. We've also added\u00a0,':',\u00a0to split the username and password from each other. Instead of being separated by a comma, we've chosen the HTML\u00a0\u00a0tag that forces each result to be on a separate line to make for easier reading.  </p> <p>**</p>"},{"location":"Pentesting%20Notes/Attacks/sql%20injection/Tryhackme%20-%20SQL%20Injection/#blind-sqli","title":"Blind SQLi","text":"<p>** Unlike In-Band SQL injection, where we can see the results of our attack directly on the screen, blind SQLi is when we get little to no feedback to confirm whether our injected queries were, in fact, successful or not, this is because the error messages have been disabled, but the injection still works regardless.

That outcome confirms to us that our SQL Injection payload was either successful or not. On the first inspection, you may feel like this limited response can't provide much information. Still, in fact, with just these two responses, it's possible to enumerate a whole database structure and contents.  </p> <p>Practical: On level three of the SQL Injection Examples Machine, you're presented with a mock browser with the following URL:  </p> <p>https://website.thm/checkuser?username=admin </p> <p>The browser body contains the contents of\u00a0{\"taken\":true}. This API endpoint replicates a common feature found on many signup forms, which checks whether a username has already been registered to prompt the user to choose a different username. Because the\u00a0taken\u00a0value is set to\u00a0true, we can assume the username admin is already registered. In fact, we can confirm this by changing the username in the mock browser's address bar from\u00a0admin\u00a0to\u00a0admin123, and upon pressing enter, you'll see the value\u00a0taken\u00a0has now changed to\u00a0false.  </p> <p>The SQL query that is processed looks like the following:  </p> <p><code>select * from users where username = '%username%' LIMIT 1;</code> </p> <p>As the only input, we have control over is the username in the query string, we'll have to use this to perform our SQL Injection. Keeping the username as\u00a0admin123, we can start appending to this to try and make the database confirm true things, which will change the state of the taken field from false to true.  </p> <p>Like in previous levels, our first task is to establish the number of columns in the users table, which we can achieve by using the UNION statement. Change the username value to the following:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1;--</code> </p> <p>As the web application has responded with the value\u00a0taken\u00a0as false, we can confirm this is the incorrect value of columns. Keep on adding more columns until we have a\u00a0taken\u00a0value of\u00a0true. You can confirm that the answer is three columns by setting the username to the below value:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3;--</code> </p> <p>Now that our number of columns has been established, we can work on the enumeration of the database. Our first task is discovering the database name. We can do this by using the built-in\u00a0database()\u00a0method and then using the\u00a0like\u00a0operator to try and find results that will return a true status. Try the below username value and see what happens:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like '%';--</code> </p> <p>We get a true response because, in the like operator, we just have the value of\u00a0%, which will match anything as it's the wildcard value. If we change the wildcard operator to\u00a0a%, you'll see the response goes back to false, which confirms that the database name does not begin with the letter\u00a0a. We can cycle through all the letters, numbers and characters such as - and _ until we discover a match. If you send the below as the username value, you'll receive a\u00a0true\u00a0response that confirms the database name begins with the letter\u00a0s.  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 where database() like 's%';--</code> </p> <p>Now you move onto the next character of the database name until you find another\u00a0true\u00a0response, for example, 'sa%', 'sb%', 'sc%' etc. Keep on with this process until you discover all the characters of the database name, which is\u00a0sqli_three.  </p> <p>We've established the database name, which we can now use to enumerate table names using a similar method by utilising the information_schema database. Try setting the username to the following value:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_three' and table_name like 'a%';--</code> </p> <p>This query looks for results in the\u00a0information_schema\u00a0database in the\u00a0tables\u00a0table where the database name matches\u00a0sqli_three, and the table name begins with the letter a. As the above query results in a\u00a0false\u00a0response, we can confirm that there are no tables in the sqli_three database that begin with the letter a. Like previously, you'll need to cycle through letters, numbers and characters until you find a positive match.  </p> <p>You'll finally end up discovering a table in the sqli_three database named users, which you can be confirmed by running the following username payload:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_three' and table_name='users';--</code> </p> <p>Lastly, we now need to enumerate the column names in the\u00a0users\u00a0table so we can properly search it for login credentials. Again using the information_schema database and the information we've already gained, we can start querying it for column names. Using the payload below, we search the\u00a0columns\u00a0table where the database is equal to sqli_three, the table name is users, and the column name begins with the letter a.  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%';</code> </p> <p>Again you'll need to cycle through letters, numbers and characters until you find a match. As you're looking for multiple results, you'll have to add this to your payload each time you find a new column name, so you don't keep discovering the same one. For example, once you've found the column named\u00a0id, you'll append that to your original payload (as seen below).  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_three' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'a%' and COLUMN_NAME !='id';</code> </p> <p>Repeating this process three times will enable you to discover the columns id, username and password. Which now you can use to query the\u00a0users\u00a0table for login credentials. First, you'll need to discover a valid username which you can use the payload below:  </p> <p><code>admin123' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 from users where username like 'a%</code> </p> <p>Which, once you've cycled through all the characters, you will confirm the existence of the username\u00a0admin.

Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. Thank you for adding us to your Routine.</p> <p>Today's Tip is about Phishing. A good article about Recognizing Phishing and tips to avoid them is on the the Federal Trade Commission's website. A link will be in the show notes. </p> <p>What is Phishing? </p> <p>Phishing is the practice of sending emails masquerading as a trusted entity, to fool someone into revealing personal info such as passwords or credit card numbers.\u00a0 Every type of communication has it's own type of phishing. For this tip we are focusing on email phishing. </p> <p>A phishing email will look like an email from Amazon saying that your delivery is delayed and to click the tracking number to fix, and then redirecting you to a fake sign in screen for Amazon where your credentials will be stole if you enter them. Or an email from netflix asking you to update your payment details and asking you to click on a button that says \"update account now\". Then redirecting you to a fake netflix account screen where your credit card number will be stolen if you enter your info. </p> <p>Other phishing attempts could say, you must confirm personal info, include a fake invoice, say you're eleigible for a government refund or offer a coupon for free items</p> <p>If you think you are being phished, Don't click on anything. Pause for a moment, and call the creditor, company, or government agency from a phone number listed on their website or invoice. Do not call a number found in the suspected phishing email or links that the email takes you to.</p> <p>The FTC offers the following suggestions to protect yourself from a phishing attack</p> <p>First, protect your phone and Computer from attack by setting them to automatically update. Almost all major Technology companies include security fixes to their updates. any amount of time that you do not install them is leaving your device vulnerable to an attack. </p> <p>Second, enable Two-factor or Mult-factor authentication on all of your accounts that offer it. They basically require to supply additional credentials to log in to your account. I did an episode on Two-factor authorization. Just pull it up and take a listen from the previous episodes.</p> <p>Finally, Protect your data by backing it up. I'm planning on doing an episode on backups soon. </p> <p>That all for today except for a few show related items.

Thank you for taking time out of your day to listen</p> <p>Today's tip is about spear phishing. A great article about spear phishing is on KnowBe4's website. As stated in a previous episode,\u00a0 knowBe4 offers it's social engineering prevention education to businesses so it may be a bit technical. But if you want a deep dive in Spear phishing it's about a 5 minute read. A link to the article will be in the show notes</p> <p>What is spear phishing? Well, we know from a previous episode that phising is the practice of sending emails masquerading as legitiamte companies to fool someone into revealing personal info like a credit card number. Spear phishing is the practice of sending emails at a specific individual or department in an organization, that appears to be a ligitimate source. </p> <p>KnowBe4 states that according to research from security firm Trend Micro, 91% of cyber attacks and the resulting data breach begin with a spear phishing email</p> <p>an Example of a spear phishing attempt could be an email from cyber criminals, masquerading as the CEO, asking an employee in accounts payable to initiate a wire transfer. Since this is something that a CEO could request, it takes a keen eye to spot the scam</p> <p>Another example could be an email from cyber criminals pretending to be a vendor, asking an employee for help with payment and requesting that they open the document attached. Some attachements could have a macro enabled word document, that once opened runs a keylogger, a screenlogger, webcam &amp; microphone recorder and grants the criminal full access and control of the computer. </p> <p>KnowBe4 offers the following tips to help avoid being spear-Phished</p> <p>First, if you get a request to transfer funds, always followup with the actual person on another channel to confirm the request in legitimate. </p> <p>Report suspicous emails before you click. </p> <p>Be cautious of emails that request fast action, or that ask that you click on a link or file to learn more</p> <p>Finally, check with your IT department on procedures for dealing with suspected spear-phishing attacks. </p> <p>That all for today except for a few freindly requests.

Thank you for adding us to your routine</p> <p>Today's tip is about SMS phishing, also known as Smishing. Norton has a good article on this and a link to it will be in the show notes</p> <p>What is Smishing? Well, as we covered in a previous episode, phishing is the nefarious practice of sending emails masquerading as legitimate companies to fool someone into revealing personal info like a credit card number. Smishing is the when a cyber thief tries to fool you into divulging personal info over SMS, text or DM.</p> <p>Smishing will often use social engineering, like pretexting, where the cyber criminal will tell you an ellaborate story to get your attention. Once they have your attention, they will try to trick you into divulging personal information such as your bank account number. </p> <p>Such an attack would be where the cyber criminal pretends to be a bank executive in charge of an large inheritance. They say that they have been trying to deposit money to your account but they must have the routing number or account number incorrect. All they need is confirmation of your bank information to complete the transaction. Once they have your bank info, they can withdraw all of your funds.</p> <p>Use the following tips to avoid being phished</p> <p>Don't reply to text messages from people that you don't know.</p> <p>Never click on links in messages from people that you don't know. And even use a bit of caution when you receive them from people that you do know. Contact them on another channel to make sure that they actually sent it to you.</p> <p>Never install an app from a link in a text message. Always look up the app on the phone's offical app store. </p> <p>Never respond to text messages from people that you do not know. Don't even send 'STOP' if requested by the message.</p> <p>Delete suspicious texts</p> <p>Also, remember that SMishing attacks can occur over text, sms, and Direct messages on most social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. </p> <p>That's all for today.

It's a great way to help protect yourself from cyber attacks</p> <p>Todays's topic is about Ransomware. KnowBe4 has a great, up to date article on today's tip and a link to it will be in the show notes.</p> <p>Ransomware is malware that encrypts your data on your device and then demands payment </p> <p>It usually infects your computer through a phishing scam. If you don't know what phishing is, please go back through our feed, as we covered it in a previous episode. Phishing attacks are meant to trick you into clicking on a link or visiting a website that downloads malware to your computer.</p> <p>There are other more aggressive ways for hackers to infect your system with malware, where they exploit security holes in your computers programs installed. However, typically, keeping your computer current with security updates wil keep you safe from this attack method</p> <p>After the Ransomware is running on your computer it encrypts all of the data, which are all of the files on your computer; documents, photos, videos, games applications and/or games. all of it</p> <p>Then it usually adds a text file to your desktop or changes your desktop background for instructions on how to pay the ransom, typically by BitCoin, for access to the ransom key. </p> <p>The easiest way to recover from a Ransomware attack is to do daily backups of you computer. We'll cover backups on the next episode. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the Ransomware problem isn't getting any better. The cyber criminals are aware that many systems get backed and less people are paying ransoms. So, they are adjusting their attack methods by destroying backups, stealing personal info, and exposing victims by leaking stolen data. </p> <p>The easiest way for you to avoid a Ransomware attack is by not clicking on suspicious link or visiting a suspicious website.</p> <p>That all for today except for a Friendly reminder. If you like what we are doing here please take a minute to rate and review us on whatever podcast platform you are using. </p> <p>Thank you again for listening and we'll talk again soon</p> <p>Since recording the Ransomware episode I came accross an article by Sophos about\u00a0 how the bad guys are using virtual machines to hide their malware's malicious intent. Please find the link to the article in the show notes. The article is a deep dive but the point that should be taken is that this new tactic is making it harder for your computer to detect these threats. Your computer may not warn you like it usually does if you encounter this strain. Again, the best defense against this attack is by not clicking on suspicious links or not visiting suspicious websites.

It is a second copy of all your important files - photos, videos, documents or any file on your computer that is an original. A backup is a copy of these items, only in another place, not your computer. </p> <p>There is a 3-2-1 backup rule that states, keep 3 copies of your backups, 2 copies on different storage devices, and 1 copy located offsite. </p> <p>Different storage devices as in an external hard drive. Western digitial or seagate make external hard drives in sizes as small as a few hundred Gigabytes and as large as multiple Terrabytes. </p> <p>The 3-2-1 rule can be overwhelming. In my opinion, just start with a single backup of your files on an external drive. Just don't stop there. Add additonal layers of protection when you have the ability to do so.</p> <p>Why should you backup your data? Because daily backups can help you recover from a Ransomware attack. If for instance, your PC happens to become infected, you can either pay the ransom, which can be $500 or more in bitcoin or restore your files from a last nights back-up, for free.</p> <p>That's all for this episode except for a friendly reminder.

Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips. Thank you for taking a few minutes out of your day to listen. Today's episode is about Whaling attacks</p> <p>vishing, phishing, smishing... and now whaling. so, what is whaling? A whaling attack is when cyber criminals use spear phishing methods to go after executive, high profile or celebrity targets. These targets often have access to or are gate-keepers to an organization's or their own money, as well as intellectual property.</p> <p>The attacker may try to trick the executive into clicking on a malicious link that attempts to steal credentials. Or the attacker may masquerade as a client or vendor requesting past due payment to be wired asap. </p> <p>Something to note about whaling is that once an attacker has access to any of the whale's credentials, they have a couple attack vectors. They can now attempt to trick employees within the organization</p> <p>the attacker can attempt to extract money by moving horizontally accross the organization to the CFO by requesting money to be wired to an account</p> <p>the attacker can attempt to fool lower level employees, who are eager to impress, into a gift card scam. where the attacker convinces the employee to purchase gift cards for a 'customer' and sends the codes on the back of the gift cards</p> <p>In the second example employees within an organization can protect themselves against a compromised whale by doing a live-authentication. This is where you reach out to the whale on another channel, preferrably in person, to authenticate the request for funds or gift cards. </p> <p>In my opinion, Any executive that acts as this is waste of time or is not willing to participate in live-authentication is foolish. As cyber criminals continue to evolve their schemes such as the newest form of ransomware, where industry secrets are leaked, It's important to always stay sharp and make the human factor harder to hack. </p> <p>That's all for this episode.

Instead Use a password Manager.</p> <p>Do not share your password with anyone, keep them private</p> <p>Passwords should be 8 characters or longer; longer means more secure.</p> <p>Include special characters, upper and lower case letters, and numbers in all passwords; more complex means more secure.</p> <p>Do not use people's names or words found in a dictionary. Cyber criminals have tools that perform something called a dictionary attack. This is when a file of common words, as found in a dictionary, are used as passwords while trying to gain access to an account. </p> <p>Do not substitute look-alike symbols for letters. Cyber criminals are savvy to (An at sign in place of an a) or (dollar sign for a S). </p> <p>a Secure Password should look like an incoherent random group of letters, numbers and special characters</p> <p>If you think someone has your password change it immediately</p> <p>Finally, STOP Reusing passwords.

All of the data on this website comes from breaches where data is exposed to people that should not be able to view it.</p> <p>According Troy he built the site as a service to the public. Data breaches are rampant and many don't realize how large or how often they occur.

Thank you for taking a few minutes out of you day to listen. It's a great way to help protect yourself from cyber-a ttacks. Today's episode covers the website Shodan.io. There is a great article on DanielMiessler.com that explains shodan from a high level overview and a small tutorial on search examples. I'll add it to the show notes.</p> <p>Shodan.io as described on it's website is a search engine for the Internet of things. Webcams, routers, servers, smart TVs, smart speakers, refridgerators, garage door openers, but more alarmingly industrial control systems, medical devices, and traffic lights can all be found via this search engine.</p> <p>Shodan was launched in 2009 by [[John]] Matherly so it's been around for a while. It has a free version and paid versions, where the paid version has more data accessible. It was created to search for devices linked to the internet. For instance, in order for these devices to be accessed remotely by their users or for important security updates, they need access to the internet. They access the internet through ports on the device. Shodan searches the internet for these devices and returns info from banners, or metadata about software running on a device. Shodan's search results have continued to skyrocket with devices added to the Internet of things. </p> <p>Shodan's usefulness is two-fold. Yes, black hat hackers can use it to search for and attempt to access anything connected to the internet.From there they could use [[credential stuffing]] on an exposed login screen to gain access.\u00a0 But more than that, the good guys use shodan as well for the very same reason but To search their exposed, vulnerable devices, and secure them.</p> <p>The bad guys have always had access to information to identify easy targets. much like if a thief wanted to rob a jewelry store, they would look for stores with no security system and doors that don't lock. Owners of a store or a website owe it to themselves to have doors that lock or require their users to use a vpn to remotely login or some other type of security measure to protect it from the bad guys</p> <p>So, why tell you about Shodan? To encourage you to protect your devices by adding or changing the password on your router, ring doorbell, garage door opener or smart light bulb or anything you may have connected to the internet. Why is this important? Because some cyber attacks jump off from gaining access to an exposed device connected to a network, such as a hospital, business or your home. </p> <p>That's all for today.</p> <p>If I helped you at all please consider supporting the podcast in any of the following ways.

Revisions may include these changes. </p> <p>Updates. The update may include a fix for a reported bug that crashes the app or program or a patch for security flaws. For example, In may 2017 The WannaCrypt/WannaCry Ransomware attack infected Microsoft [[Windows]] machines. These machines were either running an old version of [[Windows]] no longer supported by Microsoft or they were not updated with current patches to protect from this exploit.

So that being said, off we go - I was able to spend a lot of time off with my family over the Holidays so I decided to switch it up a little bit and do an exclusive interview. I had the chance to sit down with my daughter Rosie to talk about the game Animal Jam and Passwords and was delightfully surprised when she dropped a couple truth bombs. She is wise beyond her years. The Full interview is 9 min long but well worth it. Enjoy </p>"},{"location":"Podcast/USB%20our%20guest/Ep%2024%20-%20Coronavirus%20Phishing%20Scams/","title":"Ep 24   Coronavirus Phishing Scams","text":"<p>24 Coronavirus Phishing scams </p> <p>Hello and Welcome back to USB our Guest, Cyber Security Tips.</p> <p>Thank you for taking a little bit of time out of you day to better protect yourself from the bad guys</p> <p>Today's topic is Coronavirus Phishing Scams.

With the release of a couple vaccines and more to come, stimulus payments and contact tracing calls the opportunity for scammers to try and fool you out of your money or personal Identifiable Info is high. Today we'll be covering what to be on the lookout for and how to protect yourself. </p> <p>First of all, No legitimate contact tracer requires payment, your social security number, immigration status or your financial info. Anyone who says otherwise is a scammer. Also, They may send you a text stating they will be calling you but they shouldn't be sending you anything to click on. Consider clickable links or requests to\u00a0 download anything to be a scam. </p> <p>Next, Consult, \u00a0 irs.gov/\u00a0 for info regarding stimulus payments. Any info coming from text, email, Robocalls, facebook, twitter, tiktok, Instagram, MySpace, your favorite influencer or that guy at the bar that knows everything should not be taken seriously. besides, what are you doing at the bar right now...</p> <p>Ignore offers for miracle treatments or cures. Each state is responsible for their own rollout of vaccinations. At the time of this recording, Ohio had started vaccinating people 80 years or older. They have a schedule on their official Ohio.gov department of health website. </p> <p>This is a quick episode meant to reinforce what you should already know. Be skeptical with any information if it is not coming from an official source. How do you know it's an official source? call your local health department, visit irs.gov , ftc.gov and start there. </p> <p>That's all for this episode.

One month in and I Hope you are enjoying 2021. </p> <p>Today's Episode is an interview with my son Dominic. I had the chance to sit down and talk to him about Robo-calls. It was very interesting to hear Dominic's take on Robo-calls considering his phone number is fairly new. He's already heard robo-call scams regarding so-called Credit Card, Utility and Car Insurance companies. I was very impressed with how he has a healthy dose of scepticism when receiving Robo-calls, which is good because almost every Robo-Call you receive lately is a scam. As you'll hear in our conversation, never give someone from a Robo-call your personal identifiable info, Credit Card numbers or Bank account numbers.

What are they, why you should know about them and what you should do when you hear about them. FireEye has a great article on the ZeroDays that I will include in the show notes. </p> <p>Recent [[Windows]] Zero day - [[https]]://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/microsoft-fixes-[[windows]]-zero-day-in-patch-tuesday-rollout/d/d-id/1340114 </p> <p>FireEye definition - [[https]]://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/what-is-a-zero-day-exploit.html </p> <p>What is a Zero Day? From the FireEye Website, a ZeroDay vulnerability is a flaw. An unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware that can cause problems before anyone even knows something is wrong.</p> <p>Here is a Zero Day Timeline. 1st a company creates the software that contains the vulnerability and they don't know it yet. The software could be a game, a browser or an audio recorder but it could be anything.</p> <p>2nd The vulnerability is found by a researcher who reports it, an employee who patches it or a threat actor/bad guy who writes code that exploits it before anyone else has the chance to fix it. </p> <p>If the threat actor finds the exploit first, it is called a ZeroDay. A ZeroDay attack happens when the vulnerability is exploited and released before a developer has a chance to create a fix also called a patch.</p> <p>What you should do when you hear about a Zero Day? Update your system or software as soon as a patch is released. Large organizations may wait a period of time but for your consumer machine, update as soon as possible.</p> <p>For instance, If you haven't seen it yet, there was a Recent [[Windows]] Zero day found. There is a link in the show notes. If you haven't updated [[windows]] recently or don't know if [[Windows]] has updated, Pause me, and check. [[Windows]] makes it simple to check now. Press the [[windows]] key, type 'update', press enter or click on 'Check for updates'. </p> <p>Making the case for updates, again. In case you missed it, I did a whole episode on this. Just scroll up or down to episode 22 - Software Updates.</p> <p>That's all for this episode.

The company CD Projekt Red made The Witcher series and hotly criticized Cyberpunk 2077. I have 2 great articles from wired and the knowbe4 blog in the show notes. </p> <p>CyberPunk 2077 flew out the gate in December 2020 but has since been riddled with bugs and performance issues. So much so that Sony pulled the game from their online store as well as Microsoft offering refunds to players.</p> <p>Hackers have claimed to have stolen not only the source code for CyberPunk 2077 but also Personal identifiable info like investor relations, Human resources, and accounting data. CD Projekt Red reports that they have found no evidence that customer data was compromised. The hackers have threatened that without coming to some kind of agreement on ransom payment, that they will sell or outright release the source code online and the Personal identifiable info will be sold also. </p> <p>What is interesting about this story is that CD Projekt Red has declined the hackers demand for ransom and that they will restore affected systems from backup. There is no guarantee that you will get your data back after you pay a ransom and sometimes the decryption key does not fully work. Also paying ransom encourages other bad guys to do the same thing and entices others to participate in the illegal activity. </p> <p>Take a page from CD Projekt Red's playbook and start backing up your data. I even did an episode on Backups. I put a link in the show notes or just scroll up or down to get to it. By not paying ransoms you are effectively disrupting the hackers business model. Hard to do business deploying ransomware if no one is paying you, right? Back-up your data.</p> <p>Also, do not download any unauthorized version of cyberpunk2077. It is most likely malicious. Download only from Playstation, XBOX, Stadia or Steam</p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

Today\u2019s episode covers Red Canary\u2019s discovery of the Silver Sparrow malware strain. Red Canary? Silver Sparrow? So, quick note, you did not just stumble into a bird watching podcast. Because neither of those do not sound like a cyber security threat, Let\u2019s break this down.</p> <p>From their website, Red Canary is a Cyber Security company that provides analytics, reporting, automation and detection services. Include official red canary blurb. Detect is just what Red Canary did. A pair of their engineers found a strain of macOS \u201cpayload-less\u201d malware using a combination of a LaunchAgent to establish persistence, JavaScript for execution and binary compiled for Apple\u2019s new chip, M1 ARM64 architecture. </p> <p>So look, there is a lot going on there and full disclosure, I\u2019m not an Apple PC user, so I had to do a bit of research. Here are a couple definitions . </p> <p>LaunchAgent - scripts or code that automatically run to manage system processes </p> <p>Pay-load - what the malware was designed to do</p> <p>JavaScript - Programming Language</p> <p>Binary compiled for M1- Code was specifically designed for M1</p> <p>What does all this mean? Essentially, the bad guys have developed payload-less malware that uses the LaunchAgent framework that automatically runs, created using JavaScript code that is specifically designed for Apple\u2019s new M1 chip. </p> <p>The good News is that Apple is usually quick to take action and stay on top of situations like this. They have already revoked the 2 developer\u2019s certificates so if you have been infected by Silver Sparrow malware, it will not run if tried to install. </p> <p>Concerning news is that future variants could just need to be signed by a new developer to be launched</p> <p>Bad news as read from the RedCanary write up; link is in the show notes\u00a0 - \u201cthe ultimate goal of this malware is a mystery. We have no way of knowing with certainty what payload would be distributed by the malware, if a payload has already been delivered and removed, or if the adversary has a future timeline for distribution. Based on data shared with us by Malwarebytes, the nearly 30,000 affected hosts have not downloaded what would be the next or final payload.</p> <p>Finally, the purpose of the Mach-O binary included inside the PKG files is also a mystery. Based on the data from script execution, the binary would only run if a victim intentionally sought it out and launched it. The messages we observed of \u201cHello, World!\u201d or \u201cYou did it!\u201d could indicate the threat is under development in a proof-of-concept stage or that the adversary just needed an application bundle to make the package look legitimate.\u201d</p> <p>So, how do you protect yourself? Use antivirus software with real-time scanning from a trusted MAC developer and Keep your system updated. Apple will continue to work on keeping your device secure so download and install updates as soon as they are available. </p> <p>Making the case for updates, again. In case you missed it, I did a whole episode on this. Just scroll up or down to episode 22 - Software Updates and I\u2019ll put a link in the showe notes. </p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

Today\u2019s episode covers the Microsoft Server Exchange Hack. I have a few links to articles in the show notes. The articles from ZDnet article and The KrebsOnSecurity will give you a quick informative guide to the hack. The second ZDnet article has a link to Microsoft\u2019s GitHub account where they have published a script that can check the security status of Exchange Servers. The other links helps fill in the gaps with a deep dive. </p> <p>So disclaimer here, this is a fairly technical hack. The purpose of this episode is to give you a high level overview of the hack, a timeline, who is responsible and what to do? </p> <p>What is the hack? Multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers were found by the bad guys. They used these vulnerabilities to create an attack chain that can lead to Remote Code Execution or RCE, server hijacking, backdoors, data theft, and additional malware deployment. </p> <p>Timeline pulled from Krebs on Security - This timeline is not to cast additional blame but to highlight just how complicated finding and patching vulnerabilities is and how quickly things escalate. </p> <p>Jan. 5: DEVCORE alerts Microsoft of its findings.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Jan. 6: Volexity spots attacks that use unknown vulnerabilities in Exchange.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jan. 27: Dubex alerts Microsoft about attacks on a new Exchange flaw.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feb. 2: Volexity warns Microsoft about active attacks on previously unknown Exchange vulnerabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feb. 8: Microsoft tells Dubex it has \u201cescalated\u201d its report internally.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feb. 18: Microsoft confirms with DEVCORE a target date of Mar. 9 (tomorrow) for publishing security updates for the Exchange flaws. </p> </li> <li> <p>Feb. 26-27: Targeted exploitation gradually turns into a global mass-scan; attackers start rapidly backdooring vulnerable servers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 2: A week earlier than previously planned, Microsoft releases updates to plug 4 zero-day flaws in Exchange.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 3: Tens of thousands of Exchange servers compromised worldwide, with thousands more servers getting freshly hacked each hour.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 5: KrebsOnSecurity breaks the news that at least 30,000 organizations in the U.S. \u2014 and hundreds of thousands worldwide \u2014 now have backdoors installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 9: Microsoft says 100,000 of 400,000 Exchange servers globally remain unpatched.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 9: Microsoft \u201cPatch Tuesday,\u201d (the original publish date for the Exchange updates); Redmond patches 82 security holes in [[Windows]] and other software, including a zero-day vulnerability in its web browser software.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mar. 12: Microsoft says there are still 82,000 unpatched Exchange servers exposed. \u201cGroups trying to take advantage of this vulnerability are attempting to implant ransomware and other malware that could interrupt business continuity.\u201d</p> </li> </ul> <p>Who is responsible for the known attacks? Halfnium, who is a state sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group from China. While Hafnium Hails from China, they also use VPN\u2019s located in the US to disguise their location.\u00a0 But is it just Hafnium? NO. Once a Zero day has been found by bad guys and patches are released, it becomes a race by other bad guys to exploit the vulnerability. </p> <p>What do you do? If you haven\u2019t done so, First\u00a0 use the link in the show notes to the Microsoft Security Response Center and\u00a0 apply the security fixes asap. Second, use Microsoft\u2019s Github with tools for mitigation link in the show notes also. The script has three operations it performs</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mitigates against current known attacks</p> </li> <li> <p>Scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner</p> </li> <li> <p>Attempt to remediate compromises detected by the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Yet another reason to patch or update systems or programs as soon as they are available. I did an entire episode on updates, I\u2019ll put another link in the show notes or scroll up or down to get to it. </p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I\u2019m Theo and Today\u2019s episode covers RATs or Remote Access Trojans. There is a great article on DarkReading that gives an overview of what RATs do and I\u2019ll include it in the show notes. In This episode we will cover What are RATs, how do they find their way on your computer, what they do when they find themselves on there and what you can do to protect your device from them. </p> <p>So What are RAT\u2019s or Remote Access Trojans? </p> <p>To understand RAT\u2019s Let\u2019s start at the end with Trojans. A Trojan virus or Malware is simply malware concealed as something safe to download. Remote Access is allowing your device or computer to be accessed remotely by someone else\u2019s machine. If you\u2019ve ever had IT at work remote into your computer to install updates or fix your printer - This is a version of Remote Access. </p> <p>How do RAT\u2019s find their way on your computer? </p> <p>RAT\u2019s are usually installed on your computer by you. That\u2019s right, they are disguised as that free version of Photoshop, a Zoom installer from a link from a sus- email, or as we\u2019ll learn in an upcoming episode, cheat codes or modifications for PC games such as minecraft, CS:GO, Fortnite or Valorant.</p> <p>What do they do on your computer?</p> <p>Once installed the RAT will typically attempt the remote part of its name by contacting its command and control server for instructions. The RAT could be instructed to start logging keystrokes, recording the screen, webcam and/or microphone. A RAT infected computer could become part of a bot-net where large numbers of other infected computers can be used to execute Denial-of-service attacks. With the popularity of cryptocurrency, some infected machines may become unwilling cryptominers. The long and short is once a RAT is installed and given it\u2019s instructions, it can become whatever the bad guys want it to be. </p> <p>How can you protect your device from them?</p> <p>My best advice? Only download from official sources. Want MSOffice? Go to microsoft.com. Valorant? Buy from Steam or Valorant\u2019s store page. </p> <p>Never click on links in email, text, discord, twitter, or any other messenger to download software. It doesn't even matter if it\u2019s from you Moms.Never. Click on a link. In any messenger. </p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

A Remote Access Trojan is a Trojan virus or Malware concealed as something safe to download but also allows the attacker Remote Access of your device or computer. </p> <p>Tech Republic reports that Cisco Talos has discovered a campaign where attackers are concealing malware inside legitimate files. These are files that a gamer or modder would download to install cheats or make modifications to their games.</p> <p>What makes this attack interesting is that the attackers are using a cryptor, which is a tool used to conceal malicious code making it difficult to detect by security products. The cryptor makes use of Visual Basic 6, shellcode and process injection techniques to disguise the malicious payload. Visual Basic adds another layer to the obfuscation process, making the analysis of these malicious files difficult and allowing them a better chance to slip through the detection process. If these malicious files are slipping through detection and antivirus programs are letting them be downloaded without warning there is a higher likelihood that the aimbot you are downloading for Apex Legends could have a RAT hiding in it.</p> <p>And as a cherry on top? These are just files, So the bad guys can easily download them from any Dark-Mart? website. That\u2019s not a website\u2026 My point is that attackers don\u2019t need to know how to make RAT\u2019s, or malware or anything malicious anymore. They can just buy and download it from their preferred malicious software vendor on the seediest corners of the web, like I buy pop-it\u2019s for my kid on Amazon.\u00a0 Then host the RAT on a website they make on WIX or Wordpress, and title the download page \u201cBest Aim-bot for Apex\u201d. </p> <p>I\u2019m not saying that there are not cheats or mods that are safe for your computer, there are. I\u2019m not going to provide links to them either. Cheating in a multiplayer game is wrong and you have a good chance of being caught now. Long Story Short/The Long and Short is downloading cheats is an easy way for malware to end up on your machine and a RAT is one of the worst kinds. Stop cheating and Take your negative K/D lumps like we all have. </p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you demystify cyber security topics and hacks. Today\u2019s episode covers the FBI\u2019s Unprecedented helpful remote hacking of Hafnium infected servers. I\u2019ve included 2 articles and a court document in the show notes. The articles from the Verge and Engaget cover the beginning of the FBI\u2019s attempt to mitigate Hafnium\u2019s Hack. Also I just did an episode on the Microsoft exchange server hack, I\u2019ll include it in the show notes or scroll up or down to get to it. </p> <p>Much like the WannaCrypt/WannaCry Ransomware attack from 2017 where Marcus Hutchins ingeniously registered the domain that the virus was checking to identify if it were in a honeypot thus creating a kill switch for the virus. The FBI ingeniously took from what was available to them and Purple Teamed the heck out of infected servers.</p> <p>So quick review, at the beginning of the year the hackers from Hafnium were exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft exchange servers. Microsoft released a patch and a majority of servers were updated. However, At the beginning of March there were still thousands of servers still unpatched and vulnerable and a portion of those most likely have Hafnium or other attacker\u2019s web shells installed on them. What\u2019s a [[web shell]]? A script used to allow an attacker remote access after the initial compromise. </p> <p>Cue the good guys. The FBI decided to start removing the bad guy\u2019s Web Shells themselves. How, may be your first question. First, they got a court order to do so, citing that the still vulnerable server\u2019s admins may have difficulty finding and removing the shells. According to Engadget, they received permission on April 9th to run the operation for 14days. Then, they used the vulnerability found by Hafnium to access still vulnerable servers and remove the web shells. After the FBI completed their operations they started notifying server owners of the success. </p> <p>I don\u2019t normally do this but I\u2019m on the fence with this move by the FBI. </p> <p>On one side of the coin, I\u2019m glad that the US government is going after the bad guys and disrupting their plans. Any time black hat hackers are successful with an attack or receive a ransomware payment, it encourages other bad guys to do the same thing and entices others to participate in the illegal activity. However, when the bad guys' plans are foiled it discourages the activity.</p> <p>On the other side of the coin, I\u2019m concerned with the precedent that this activity sets. This is an unprecedented move by the FBI. I don\u2019t recall ever hearing of a government entity going to these lengths to disrupt a hacker group's activity. My initial thought was, Microsoft created and released the patch to fix the vulnerability. This is out of my scope but couldn\u2019t they have sent a notification stating that if not fixed within a certain time frame that they would push an update to [[Windows]] defender to apply the fix? </p> <p>I\u2019m interested to see what happens next. What future breach will the FBI consider remotely accessing systems again?</p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you demystify cyber security topics and hacks. Today\u2019s episode is about the Ransomware attack that occurred on May 7th that forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down its operations.</p> <p>Alright, There are a few moving parts </p> <p>From ZDNet - the victim, Colonial Pipeline provides 45% of the east coast's fuel including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, and jet fuel and transports fuel to almost all east coast states. </p> <p>From Krebs on Security- The Ransomware gang DarkSide - If you didn\u2019t know any better you would think their advertisement aimed at affiliates to use their ransomware was Legit off of LinkedIn. The advertisement bills Darkside as a Ransomware-as-a-service platform. What does that mean? Much like how I described in the RAT\u2019s episode- You, me, anyone can go on any \u201cDark-mart\u201d website and download a Ransomware service. You\u2019d select your Ransomware, add to cart and pay with crypto... or would it be gift card codes\u2026. Anyway, my point is, anyone can do this and run the Ransomware-as-a-service like they run any other program on their computer. </p> <p>From Bloomberg - The compromise - Mandiant, part of FireEye was brought in to respond to the attack. They told bloomberg that Compromised VPN login credentials were used to access Colonials system. I have not been able to find what level employee\u2019s credentials were used. The compromised accounts password has been discovered in a batch of leaked passwords on the dark web. What does that mean? Speculating and generally here, because the details have not been made public, but that password could have been included in a [[brute force]] or dictionary attack to attempt to access Colonial\u2019s systems. </p> <p>The repercussions - upon Colonial bringing down their system to mitigate the damage done by DarkSide, east coast gas prices shot up midday and sent droves of people to gas stations to stockpile fuel. Some gas stations were reporting outages. On May 13th Colonial had reported that operations were up running again.</p> <p>The case for not reusing passwords - By reusing passwords, the bad guys found an attack vector. If a data breach occurs, the passwords end up on a new list on the dark web waiting to be bought and used in another attack. Best advice here is, Stop reusing passwords. What\u2019s the best way to avoid reusing passwords? Use a password manager. The easiest one to use is in your browser. In my opinion, if you don\u2019t have any way to keep track of your \u2018different\u2019 passwords, this is a good place to start. Then listen to my episode on passwords. I\u2019ll include it in the show notes or scroll up or down to get to it.</p> <p>The case for having backups - Backing up your system is the easiest way to mitigate a ransomware attack. If you were to be infected by ransomware then you could restore from backup. By backing up your systems regularly you can give ransomware the middle finger.</p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you break down cyber security topics and hacks. First off I want to send a sincere thank you to everyone who listens to my Podcast. It recently surpassed 2000 listens and honestly I couldn\u2019t be happier. Considering I get to talk about what I truly have a passion for and hopefully I\u2019m helping people protect themselves from a breach. Thank you. That being said, Today\u2019s episode is about the EA or Electronic Arts hack. I have links to the articles referenced in the show notes. This episode is a little longer since there is a lot of ground to cover and a lot of technical jargon to dig through but hang in there. </p> <p>First off - The Breach </p> <p>Around June 6th, The bad guys claimed to have accessed and stolen data, totaling 780 GB, from Electronic Arts such as; source code for FIFA 21, code for it\u2019s matchmaking server, source code for the Frostbite engine used to power Battlefield, software development kits, and bundles of code. </p> <p>From \u2018The Record\u2019 Recorded Future\u2019s blog, The hackers claimed to have gained access to the data by using purchased Authentication cookies for $10 of an EA employee off the dark web. Then they used the auth cookies to mimic an already-logged in EA employee\u2019s account and access EA\u2019s Slack channel. </p> <p>Then, Vice reports, the malicious actors fooled an EA IT support agent and requested a multifactor authentication token, granting them access to the internal network.</p> <p>To Summarize, the bad guys used a small but powerful piece of data, an auth cookie, to present themselves as an employee to trick an IT employee into handing over a MFA token, which allowed them access to the network. This a crude summary but what I want to stress is how the bad guys pieced together small stolen info to break into EA. </p> <p>ZDNet reports that Isreali cybersecurity firm Cyberpion informed EA of domains that could be subject to takeovers through misconfiguration. EA has at least 6 domains vulnerable to takeover listed in the article. </p> <p>The Record also reports that the bad guys dumped the data on an underground cybercrime forum on July 26th and sold stolen files to a 3rd party buyer after a failed attempt at extorting money from EA. </p> <p>ZDNet also reports that Hackers are selling access to FIFA matchmaking servers and other EA games. </p> <p>EA calls the haul that the bad guys stole, a \u201climited amount of game source code\u201d and \u201cNo player data was accessed...we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy\u201d. Just to be safe, If you have a EA account, I would change your password.</p> <p>So, there is a lot to unpack here. Here\u2019s some definitions. </p> <p>How much data is 780GB? Well it\u2019s \u00be of a 1 terrrabyte\u00a0 Western digital backup drive or about 98 - 8GB Thumb Drives</p> <p>Source code is any collection of code, using a programming language, for example C#, Python or Ruby to create applications or games.</p> <p>FIFA is the Federation Internationale de Football Association - Soccer or football\u2019s World governing body</p> <p>Matchmaking - Many games have a pvp or player vs player mode where people can play against each other. To make this mode more fair and enjoyable, developers use matchmaking to match players with similar stats and ability. </p> <p>Frostbite engine - A Game engine is a software framework that is primarily designed for the development of video games. Frostbite is a game engine that is exclusive to Electronic Arts. </p> <p>Software development kits (SDK) - a SDK is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of\u00a0 hardware, an Operating system, or programming language that software developers use to create applications for those devices, OS\u2019s or programming languages.</p> <p>Authentication cookies - a token that is stored on the client/your device and the server/the app or website you are using to manage the connection. In this case they saved the login details of the of an employee</p> <p>Slack - A messaging app primarily used by employees of businesses to communicate. </p> <p>Multifactor Authentication Token is an additional step in the form of a random number that generates regularly and is required for access of an account after a username and password has been provided. Usually sent to a separate device.</p> <p>Thoughts</p> <p>Interestingly, the bad guys either decided not to encrypt data and steal Personal Identifiable information or couldn\u2019t access it. It seems that without that kind of leverage, companies feel better about declining demands from the bad guys. Especially if they have backups or in EA\u2019s position, an online marketplace where their games can be downloaded legally.</p> <p>As for the domains, why not just take them down and wipe the [[DNS]] records? The domains may be in use publicly or privately or they may be holding on to them to sell in the future. At any rate, EA may need to review security practices. At the time of recording only one of the domains in the ZDNet article was accessible via a browser.</p> <p>IMO, we are starting to see the beginnings of tiny leaks of data coming back to haunt us. An Auth cookie is a powerful but small piece to the internet. If a bad guy obtains access to it they can access an account on your network and the network itself with a little bit of social engineering.</p> <p>Another\u00a0 thing\u00a0 to consider is with access to FIFA source code, SDKs, and matchmaking servers the bad guys can essentially run an online \u201cFIFA\u201d server with malicious intentions. The download of the malicious \u201cFIFA\u201d or accessing a malicious matchmaking server could include a backdoor to your device that the bad guys could use to install ransomware, cryptominers or other malicious code. Did I say malicious enough?</p> <p>What can you do as a consumer? Only Buy from legit game merchants. Offering malicious games is a business just like any other business. Best way to shut them down is by not using their service or downloading their software. Nothing is free. You pay for it with your data or by giving the bad guys access to your device.</p> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you break down cyber security topics and hacks and how they affect you. Today's episode covers the recent Twitch hack. Links to the articles, twitter posts and blogs referenced are in the show notes. First and Foremost, if you are a twitch streamer or have a twitch account for viewing, I highly advise, pausing this episode and changing your Twitch password and if you haven\u2019t done so, enabling 2-factor authentication. That being said, </p> <p>On the morning of 10/6 Twitch confirmed on twitter that the leak was authentic stating Quote</p> <p>\u201cWe can confirm a breach has taken place. Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this. We will update the community as soon as additional information is available. Thank you for bearing with us.\u201d</p> <p>Early next morning Twitch released another update stating \u201cOur investigation is ongoing, and we are in the process of analyzing all of the relevant logs and data to assess actual impact.\u201d along with a link to their blog for more updates. As of 10/11 only 2 posts exist. The most recent post from 10/7 notifying streamers that, quote \u201cOut of an abundance of caution\u201d all stream keys have been reset and the post from 10/6 ligitimizing the breach. It reveals that quote \u201cWe have learned that some data was exposed to the internet due to an error in a Twitch server configuration change that was subsequently accessed by a malicious third party.\u201d and continues \u201cAt this time, we have no indication that login credentials have been exposed. We are continuing to investigate. -- Additionally, full credit card numbers are not stored by Twitch, so full credit card numbers were not exposed.\u201d</p> <p>Initially reported by Video Games Chronicle, The leak was posted on 4chan by an anonymous hacker who stated the leaks intentions to, quote \u201cfoster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space\u201d because, quote \u201ctheir community is a disgusting toxic cesspool\u201d. The leaked Twitch data reportedly contains the following. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Twitch\u2019s entire source code with commit history \u201cgoing back to its early beginnings\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Creator payout reports from 2019</p> </li> <li> <p>Mobile, desktop and console Twitch clients</p> </li> <li> <p>Proprietary SDKs or Software development kits and internal AWS services used by Twitch</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cEvery other property that Twitch owns\u201d including IGDB and CurseForge</p> </li> <li> <p>An unreleased Steam competitor, codenamed Vapor, from Amazon Game Studios</p> </li> <li> <p>Twitch\u2019s internal \u2018red teaming\u2019 tools (designed to improve security by having staff pretend to be hackers)</p> </li> </ul> <p>What does all this mean? Here are my take-aways.</p> <p>Twitch\u2019s source code with commit history, twitch clients, SDK\u2019s, Vapor - If the bad guys were so inclined, and they will be, they could use this data to make an exact duplicate of twitch or at least it\u2019s home and login pages, that could be used for credential stealing. Never click on links anywhere that redirect you to login.</p> <p>Creator payouts - This is giving the bad guys confirmed money targets for hacking. Some of these creators are making millions and are now prime targets for the bad guys to go after. </p> <p>Red teaming tools - The bad guys now have access to tools that twitch uses to test their own security. And worse yet, they know what Twitch is looking for and what they are missing when they are Penetration testing their own systems. </p> <p>Again, if you haven\u2019t changed your Twitch password and enabled 2 factor authentication, do so now. Twitch has said that they have no indication that login credentials have been exposed, not that login credentials have not been accessed. Perhaps take this opportunity to start using a password manager, because if passwords have been stolen, they could be used on another attack. Which could be bad, especially if you reuse passwords. Stop.. Reusing.. Passwords..</p> <p>One last observation, This breach shares characteristics of FaceBook\u2019s outage from10/4 in which Facebook\u2019s \u201cengineering teams have learned that configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication. This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt,\" Although Facebook experienced an outage and Twitch a breach, I thought it was interesting that the phrasing, referencing \u201cconfiguration changes\u201d, in these two events were similar. </p> <p>That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you break down cyber security news and hacks and how they affect you. Today\u2019s episode covers the vulnerability affecting Java logging package, Log4j. This episode took a little longer to make\u00a0 than expected due to its complexity. This episode will be a little longer and a bit technical but will not be a deep dive. I am not an expert in this exploit, but I\u2019m including tons of links in the show notes with what I feel are excellent resources on the Log4j. Also, a break from the norm,\u00a0 I will start and end the episode with what I feel you as a user should be doing to keep your laptop or desktop safe. </p> <p>What should you do? Make sure updates or patches for your desktop and laptop as well as programs and applications on them are applied as developers release them.\u00a0 I did an entire episode on updates, I\u2019ll put a link in the show notes or scroll up or down to get to it.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s jump in. </p> <p>So, the 50,000ft view is this- Log4j is a Java based logging utility that is part of the Apache Logging services and a project of the Apache Software foundation. According to the Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities page - Apache Log4j versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing JNDI URI which can execute remote code</p> <p>Ok so that was a mouthful already, what did all that mean? Here is a break down </p> <p>Logging refers to files that contain timestamped data of events that occur in an operating system of software</p> <p>Log4j is the Logging package for Java</p> <p>Java is computer programming language</p> <p>Apache Logging Services create and maintain the Log4j utility</p> <p>Apache Software Foundation is the organization that supports many open source software projects like Apache logging services</p> <p>Remote Code Execution (RCE) is just what it sounds like. It allows an attacker to remotely execute malicious code from their computer to another that they may not have legitimate access to. </p> <p>The JDBC Appender writes log events to a relational database table using standard JDBC. JDBC or Java Database connectivity is the JavaSoft specification of a standard application programming interface that allows Java programs to access database management systems</p> <p>JNDI or Java Naming and Directory Interface is an application programming interface (API) that provides naming and directory functionality to applications written using the Java programming language</p> <p>URI or Universal Resource identifier is a member of this universal set of names in registered name spaces and addresses referring to registered protocols or name spaces.</p> <p>So, that was a lot. Long and short, This logging utility is used in known and unknown places by a lot of vendors and will be around for a while. List of the attack surfaces is a link in the show notes</p> <p>IMO opinion the best resource I came across for understanding log4j was a [[TryHackMe]] room created by [[John]] Hammond. [[John]] writes </p> <p>\u201cPlease use the information you learn in this room to better the security landscape. Test systems you own, apply patches and mitigations where appropriate, and help the whole industry recover. This is a very current and real-world threat -- whether you are a penetration tester, red teamer, incident [[responder]], security analyst, blue team member, or what have you -- this exercise is to help you and the world understand and gain awareness on this widespread vulnerability. It should not be used for exploitative gain or self-serving financial incentive (I'm looking at you, beg bounty hunters)</p> <p>Additionally, please bear in mind that the developers of the log4j package work on the open source project as a labor of love and passion. They are volunteer developers that maintain their project in their spare time. There should be absolutely no bashing, shame, or malice towards those individuals. As with all things, please further your knowledge so you can be a pedestal and pillar for the information security community. Educate, share, and help.\u201d</p> <p>End - So, again, What should you do to protect yourself? Make sure updates or patches for your desktop and laptop as well as programs and applications on them are applied as developers release them. </p> <p>How do they do this? Many apps or programs can be set to update themselves. If they don\u2019t, typically, the app will indicate in a menu or a pop-up that an update is ready to be installed. </p> <p>That\u2019s all for today\u2019s episode.

I\u2019m Theo, here to help you break down cyber security news and hacks and how they affect you. </p> <p>Today's episode covers the recent LastPass Breach, or as they put it from their last blog, a\"Security Incident\".  I've added links to the show notes that include LastPass's blog on the incident as well as other reports on the breach. This episode is organized as follows. I'll breakdown their blog post paragraph by paragraph, peppering in reports on the breach and end with suggestions to better protect yourself.  That being said let's jump in. </p> <p>What happened? From LastPass' blog \u201cTwo weeks ago, we detected some unusual activity within portions of the LastPass development environment. After initiating an immediate investigation, we have seen no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults.\u201d  Unusual activity like what? No details have been shared on exactly what unusual activity was detected. If last pass has an intrusion detection It could have been high network activity while the bad guys made off with the source code as will be mentioned in the next section. What is a development environment? It's where new code and projects are created before being tested and released to the public and into their live product, that you use if you are a LastPass user.  Why is that worriesome? The bad guys can now duplicate LastPass's environment to pracitce their attacks on. They don't have to worry about being stealthy. They can make as much noise or generate as much traffic as they want on thier own systems and practice being covert later. They can also duplicate LastPass' website for user name / password or credential stealing. The last line that states \"we have seen no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data\" is commonplace now while disclosing breachs. They have not stated that they know 100% that the bad guys have not accessed customer data but at the same time are not asking users to reset passwords.  Tangent here - LastPass uses something they call Zero-Knowledge. This means that no one has access to your master password or the data stored in your vault, except you. Not even LastPass. The LastPass service also uses End-point Encryption and it happens exclusively at the device level before syncing to LastPass for safe storage, so only users can decrypt their data. </p> <p>\u201cWe have determined that an unauthorized party gained access to portions of the LastPass development environment through a single compromised developer account and took portions of source code and some proprietary LastPass technical information. Our products and services are operating normally.\" How was it compromised? According to Bleeping computer, Lastpass' CEO Karim Troubba states \"the threat actor was able to impersonate the developer after he \"had successfully authenticated using multi-factor authentication.\"\" No other information has been given on just how they authenicated and with what factor. So What\u2019s a developer account? In comparison a user account will provide access to the LastPass service, where a developer account gives you access to the LastPass software that runs the service. Good news here, Bleeping Computer reports that only the Build Release team can can push code from Development into Production, and even then, Toubba states that the process involves code review, testing and validation stages.  Source code? Source Code is the code that runs LastPass service. </p> <p>\"In response to the incident, we have deployed containment and mitigation measures, and engaged a leading cybersecurity and forensics firm. While our investigation is ongoing, we have achieved a state of containment, implemented additional enhanced security measures, and see no further evidence of unauthorized activity.  \" Containment and Mitigation? From Toubba's blog post on LastPass \"LastPass Development environment is physically separated from, and has not direct connectivity to LastPass' Production environment. \" What cybersecurity and forensics firm? Last Pass hired Mandiant to investigate the breach. Mandiant has been hired in the past by Sony after their 2014 breach, and more recently by T-mobile after their breach last year.</p> <p>\"Based on what we have learned and implemented, we are evaluating further mitigation techniques to strengthen our environment. We have included a brief FAQ below of what we anticipate will be the most pressing initial questions and concerns from you. We will continue to update you with the transparency you deserve.\" (edited) In my opinion, aside from the initial 2 week breach notification delay as reported on LastPass' blog, this has been a decently transparent disclosure of a breach. Maybe that's because LastPass' architecture is set up to better mitigate a breach, not to hope one doesn't occur. LastPass has notified customers when they detected \"unusual activity\", were upfront about what the bad guys stole and what you should do as a user. </p>"},{"location":"Podcast/USB%20our%20guest/Ep%2040%20-%20LastPass%20Breach/#suggestions","title":"Suggestions","text":"<ul> <li>Go back and listen to episode 4 on Password Managers. </li> <li>If you use LastPass as a password manager, and Although they haven't suggested it, I would consider changing your master password.</li> <li>YubiKey - these little devices are the \"something you have\" part of Multifactor authentication and integrate with LastPass</li> </ul> <p>That's all for today's episode.

I started my career by enlisting in the US Army at age 18. At that point I knew that I wanted to work with computers and that I was poor. I needed a leg up. So, I joined the Army for the GI Bill so that I could afford college when I got out. During my time as an enlisted member, I learned advanced networking skills, how to be a leader of people, and became a part of the largest naturally occurring professional/social network: US Military Veterans. What's super cool is that during that time in my life, I got to jump from airplanes, travel the world and eventually work for the White House Communications Agency and their secure communications switchboard -- for two different presidential administrations: Both G.W. Bush and B. Obama. After leaving the Army in 2009, I went to college. I had a rough time choosing a major because I had in the interim become interested in health and medicine-- to be Pre-Med, you can choose any degree, so I chose initially Bio-Informatics, then that degree plan was cancelled by the university due to lack of enrollment. Then I chose philosophy, and I think before starting my first term I'd switch at least once more to a Medicinal Chemistry degree -- eventually settling for a degree called Biology &amp; Society at the sort of intersection of Biomedical Ethics and enough Biology to be able to understand and explain to anyone who would listen. I then did a Master's degree focusing on the history and biomedicalization of Autism in the United States. Afterwards, I went to study History &amp; Philosophy of Biology at the University of Toronto with a woman named Marga Vicedo who was working on a history of Autism at that time. I spent a year there and earned a Master's of Arts degree, then returned to Arizona State University to pursue a PhD in History and Philosophy of Biology. In late 2017, I had become disallusioned with what I was up to and decided to return to the working world (rather than the academic world)... I continued working on my dissertation while working but ultimately stopped writing the dissertation in summer 2019 and left that PhD program in ABD (all but dissertation) status. Upon exiting academia, I picked up a job working as a career tech instructor in Information Technology. I taught young people, roughly Juniors/Seniors in high school, how to work on the Infrastructure side of IT (basically help desk, system administration, and networking type roles). I continued in that role for four years, earning a third Master's degree in Education in the process. I worked before and through covid 19, and just after starting the school year in 2022 a recruiter reached out through LinkedIn and I was quickly offered an interview. I interviewed for a Level 2 System Administrator role with my current employer, Belcan LLC, contracted to support GE Aviation. I started working that role in October of 2022. For several months, I was waiting on a security clearance to get approved and thereafter found myself thrown into an ill-defined role and thriving. </p> <p>Essentially, I would come into work for four straight months, and on Tuesday each week, I'd get assigned a set of audit tasks to complete. The first week, I spent a small period of time trying to understand what was being asked of me and how to do it. By the second week, I thought, can't this be scripted? By the third week of the first month, I had boiled the entire audit tasking down to a small set of scripts that I would kick off and I'd finish a week's worth of assigned work in about 15 minutes. Now, since I was new, this was a good opportunity for me to get to know other people, who the players were, how the environment was structured and how to get access to do more things to be a little more helpful. By the end of the third month, I had developed an anticipatory set of PowerShell and Batch scripts to assist with possible problems with a huge VMware migration effort. Those scripts were written so generally, and repurposed many times, that we were able to address a litany of tickets that probably would have inundated us for several weeks, if not months, otherwise. By February of 2023, I had responsibilities on the Network Team and [[Linux]]/HPC Team splitting my time between work and technologies. By the end of March, I was offered a promotion and a leadership opportunity as one of the managers of our service desk. Since taking that role on, I have built a team, established tons of new processes, new training and team development initiatives, and have been recognized for my capability to effect influence far beyond the scope of my job role. In that time, I've also interviewed around 20 job candidates for our entry level (L1) system administrator role.</p> <ul> <li>Location: Currently around Cincinnati, Ohio-- spent a great deal of time (years of my life) in North Carolina, Washington-DC, and Phoenix-AZ</li> <li>Age: 41</li> <li>Previous jobs: Staff Sergeant(US Army, White House Comms), Student &amp; PhD candidate/researcher, Career Tech Instructor for IT</li> <li>Education level: I have a BS in Biology, three Masters degrees: Biology, History &amp; Philosophy of Science, Education, ABD for my PhD in History &amp; Philosophy of Science, and recently started working on a second Bachelors degree in Cloud Computing with WGU (which I'll finish mid-2024).</li> <li>Self-Taught Things: Everything to do with IT, Coding, Cybersecurity has been self-taught.</li> <li> <p>Importance of Certs: Two things</p> <ol> <li>Get your foot in the door </li> <li>regulatory compliance <ul> <li>Aside from that, experience is king in the IT/Cyber career space.</li> <li>Small caveat: If you're working in a space within IT that limits your capability to get the kind of experience you need to move forward in an area that you want to work in, Certs can grease the skids.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>How did I get this job: LinkedIn profile + Speaking Confidently and Competently during technical interview questions AND simultaneously expressing personality characteristics of someone that others would want to work with (FIT!)</p> </li> <li> <p>Networking vs LinkedIn vs In-Person, etc: </p> <ul> <li>There's a saying out there... \"It's who you know...\" Any candidate who has a current employee vouching for them will typically get priority.. For what it's worth, this isn't as damning as it seems for those who don't have that sort of networking going on. Out of several folks we hired over the last year, only one of those individuals fit this description. For entry level roles, surprisingly, a great deal of my attention is focused on an individual's fit with the current team, and secondarily, how much OJT will be required for this person and getting a sense for where we'd need to start. There are some things that people do, either on resumes or during the interview process that are pretty damning: 1. Lying about a certification that you have (Speaks to a lack of integrity) 2. Listing a certification, like the CCNP, and lacking fundamental knowledge and capabilities that someone with that cert should have (Again, integrity) 3. Not trying to think and work through technical interview questions at all -- as I used to tell my students, giving up isn't an option for people in our field, we're the people that folks who have already given up turn to for help... what does it say about you when you're first instinct is to say I don't know, and you won't even try? 4. clearly attempting to google search answers to technical questions during the interview -- regularly, I want you to look to google to see what it says before trying to escalate further, but Interviews aren't about trying to figure out what further OJT that google needs. 5. excessive frustration &amp; lashing out or getting testy/difficult with interviewers... it's critical no matter how nervous you are, to keep your composure. Lack of capability to act professionally under pressure speaks to your ability to work well with others on a team. 6. Have good answers to common questions: Strengths, Weaknesses, Times that you failed, etc. There's nothing more damning than a candidate who can't speak to a single time that they failed at something, and how they overcame... All of these common questions boil down to a single critical thing that employers want to know: What VALUE will YOU bring to the team? That's why even questions that focus on adversity that you've faced, always involve a [[pivot]] -- so that you can express what your value is.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Stepping out of your comfort zone:</p> <ul> <li>This is a double edged sword. For an entry level role, everything will feel uncomfortable... start to finish. You'll feel like an imposter. Frankly, you are one. Accept it. That said, any working professional, regardless of field, had to start somewhere and that somewhere is what I lovingly call \"The Zone of Scrap\". For two reasons, you're expected to fight for your place and existence on the team... I want someone on the team who wants to be there and will demonstrate their desire to learn and grow every day they come into work. The second reason I call it \"The Zone of Scrap\": it's important to find yourself \"at the right place and right time\" to get new experiences and learn new things. To some extent, the L2 and L3 system administrators aren't going to invite you in to learn new things, but then again... you can take advantage of the fact that those same folks aren't typically going to ask you to go away either. Creatively leverage the fact that the leader &amp; manager of your team probably has expectations that the team grow, develop, and promote from within.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Current role: L3 System Administrator &amp; Senior Technical Leader with technical responsibilities for Networking/[[Linux]]/HPC -- also Service Desk Manager</p> </li> <li> <p>Expectations of my role: </p> <ul> <li>PROACTIVELY SOLVE PROBLEMS. DISCOVER PROBLEMS THAT WE CAN'T SEE. <ul> <li>Some problems that have to do with technology, can have creative / process oriented solutions... for example, it's not the software install that is the problem, but the way that we go about installing the software (as a standard process) that's a problem? A great deal of my time and effort is spent thinking about ways to manage without managing-- Nobody likes a micro-manager, but it's critical when you do managed service work that as many of your service desk's regular processes are covered by kbs, documentation, or SOPs. One might think that this makes the job kind of trivial, but it also allows members of my team to say: \"Look, I was following our approved procedure for this kind of thing.\" Nobody is getting fired for doing their job, especially when the tasks of that job are etched in stone and approved by management.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hours:</p> <ul> <li>I usually get in at 6:30am and leave around 3:30pm. It's 9 hours, but I'm not a time tracker -- I'm a productivity tracker. To some extent, I build in a lot of \"down time\" during my day. I check in with people, make sure things are running smoothly, anticipate my boss's needs and address problems before he brings them up, and generally I try to make sure my day overlaps with the bulk of our two service desk shifts... (one shift starts at 7am, the second shift starts at 9am).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Testing Timeline: </p> <ul> <li>I think this interview question is geared toward one of our compliance standards... Our contract has two basic obligations for the first 90 days of employment. The first is that someone must not be a foreign national, and be able to obtain a security clearance (interim within 90 days, full thereafter). The second compliance requirement is the DOD 5870 Baseline certification requirement... depending on the role you work, it could be IAT level II, which is satisfied by the [[CompTIA]] Security+ or it could be the IAM level II which requires a certification like [[CompTIA]] CASP+ or CISSP. For our entry level system administrators, I believe the standard is IAT2.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Working with others: </p> <ul> <li>Yes. My success depends on my ability to trust that members of my team will do their job and continue to improve... At the management level, this is a balancing act. I typically say \"firm but fair\". It's essentially the \"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed\" response encapsulated in a people management approach. For instance, it's unfair for me to expect things of my team, when those expectations are never written and/or stated out loud-- if they don't know what to do, I should have no expectation that they do...  In instances like this, the only thing to do is write down what needs to be read &amp; heard, and have a conversation with the team about what needs to change. A good recent for instance with this... we drew up a little visual task board that tracks where people on the team are going. At first blush, it may seem a little micro-managey, but we explained... one critical unstated standard on any service desk is that during operating hours, the service desk is never empty. However, many times throughout the day, management would go to our service desk room and notice the room would be empty. We set a minimum standard that at least two people need to be present during our peak hours (10am-2pm). Answering the why question is critical for things like this and making adherence as simple as possible, is also critically important. Our goal with this VTB is not to say \"I need to know when you use the restroom\", but instead to say... We, as a team, know where all of our team members are right now and that we have minimum personnel present at the service desk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Career advice for those getting started:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The fundamentals are critically important. There's a cute little meme image going around about people who desire to work in cybersecurity, skipping the first 5 steps of a staircase. This goes back to some advice that I've heard about people who desire to work in Cyber spending a few years, at first, doing their \"system time\". That system time is basically giving you the opportunity to verify that you're well versed in \"the fundamentals\" -- we'll go ahead and black-box that term, basically as a stand-in for a bunch of often unstated expectations about technical knowledge that anyone who works in the first is supposed to know and be capable of troubleshooting, de-facto, without the need to google search. i.e. What's an A record or a AAAA record? What's an ARP table? What are the layers of the Network Model (OSI / TCP-IP)?</p> </li> <li> <p>Treat every problem that you solve like it will need to be solved 500 or 1000 more times. Sure, this once, you used the GUI the first time... but what if 300 tickets came in and you needed to solve each one in that same way. Figuring out how to do things at the command line, with batch/bash/powershell/perl scripting allows you to leverage the logic of code to solve business critical problems efficiently. Also, how awesome does it feel when the first time you do something maybe it takes you 30 minutes or 45 minutes, then you develop a script that allows you to click a button to start the script, specify a computer name or a list of computer names, then you solve the same problem 300 times over in less time than it took you the very first time. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Industry Professional interview outline     TimeZone? - - availability - weekdays ?? - Weekends ?? - voice, tts, video, avatar? - Who are you? background - as much or little as you are comfortable with.      - location     - age     - previous jobs     - scripting lang? pearl, bash, batch, powershell     - do you worry about being noticed for the extra work you do? toot your horn? - What is your education level (or lack of) - What have you taught yourself? - How important are certs? - How you did you land your job in cyber security to get in the industry? - How necessary is Networking?

I wanted that computer so much. I had been reading IT and programming books for months ahead of actually getting a computer. I even stole a computer magazine that I couldn't afford with my pocket money (and got caught). From the VIC-20, I went on to a Commodore 128, then the Amiga, and finally a fully kitted out 80386 PC. In high school, I learned Pascal and Forth. My coding skills were constantly improving because I read every book on software engineering our local library could offer. When I was 18, I developed a payroll accounting application to make my mum's job easier. It was pretty clear that I'd study computer science, but there also was a short period when I considered becoming a catholic priest. When, after high school, my mandatory military service ended unexpectedly early creating a gap of a few months before I could start college, my mum pulled some strings to get me a sort of internship at the local nuclear power plant. There, I developed a database application for managing engine maintenance cycles. My manager was so impressed that he gave me a bonus and offered me a freelance contract so I could continue my work into college. This sort of doing professional work on the side continued when I encountered [[Linux]] in 1993 and shortly after started a systems administration business. It didn't work out and in the end cost me a lot of money, and almost my degree as well.  - pull up pics of these devices -  VIC-20, Commodore 128, then the Amiga, and 80386 PC. - What did you do with books? line by line? reproduce code? your own project? - Priesthood? me too - Developing projects - systems admin business that didn't work out - what did you learn</p>"},{"location":"Podcast/USB%20our%20guest/Ep%2044%20-%20MonoSpace%20Mentor/#previous-jobs","title":"Previous jobs","text":"<p>After getting my B.S. in computer science, my passion for [[Linux]] led me to work as a SuSE Certified [[Linux]] Trainer. I relished helping people understand all the complexities in system and network administration. At a [[Linux]] conference, I met a colleague from uni who was now the IT manager at one of Germany's leading ISPs. She told me that she was looking for a trainer who could teach her IT organization the basics of system administration, database management and kernel development. I jumped at the challenge, got myself another stack of books, and created a curriculum that I then taught over three months. When my work was finished, I had a meeting with the IT manager who hired me and someone from HR. They offered me the opportunity to start a new team at the company whose job it would be to run the company's user management service, billing system and ERP software. A new challenge! A few years later, the company was acquired by an even bigger internet service provider, and I got in charge of three teams running the core services for the whole IT organization such as databases, online payments, storage and backup systems. Eventually, I got a new manager, and things went downhill. In 2009, I was ** let go under dubious circumstances (that story will boggle your mind).**  Realizing that there's no such thing as a \"secure job\", I decided to give entrepreneurship another shot. Given my rather bad track record with running my own businesses, this wasn't a decision we took lightly.

Please send any questions to me in a Dm or chat while we are live and we'll cover them. </p> <ul> <li>Who are you? <ul> <li>background - as much or little as you are comfortable with. <ul> <li>\"I'm a [[Linux]] Administrator in HPC/Research Computing with a background that's taken many twists and turns. As a kid, I was drawn to filmmaking and the arts but was later steered towards careers that required analytical skills and big-picture thinking. I initially studied economics and political science in university and worked in various roles, including IT recruiting and accounts payable. However, my journey took a turn when I returned to university, began work in desktop support, and truly discovered a passion for technology. Now I realize that passion was present earlier than I thought.\"</li> <li>what kind of movies would you make? - Wes Anderson style</li> </ul> </li> <li>What is your current role? <ul> <li>\"I currently work as a [[Linux]] Administrator in HPC/Research Computing, where I manage and support high-performance computing systems used for research and scientific computing.\"</li> <li>\"I work as a [[Linux]] Administrator in HPC/Research Computing, managing high- performance computing systems for research. My tasks include cluster management, SLURM scheduler optimization, parallel file system management, RHEL 8 server configuration, LAMP/ stack utilization for web services, networking troubleshooting, user support, bash scripting for automation, and infrastructure design for optimal HPC performance. I also spend time in the data center for routine maintenance and to install and  deploy state-of-the-art architecture. For example, we recently received state-of-the-art NVIDIA AI superchips called the 'Grace Hopper' boxes in the data center. This was my first time working with such equipment and helping to install [[Linux]] on the box.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>location - \"I live in the United States and work in academia.\"</li> <li>age - \"You know, they say 'never ask a woman her age and a man his salary' (but seriously, I am in my mid-30s).\"</li> <li>previous jobs -\"Before my current role in HPC/[[Linux]], I worked odd jobs in IT recruiting, administration, and accounts payable. Eventually, I entered IT in an entry-level desktop support role and spent a few years grinding it out in application layer support. In these various jobs, I gained valuable skills in communication, organization, and problem-solving that I continue to utilize today.\"<ul> <li>Don't be afraid to fail</li> <li>be positive</li> </ul> </li> <li>scripting lang? - <ul> <li>\"I regularly use scripting languages like Python and Bash to automate tasks and streamline processes in my role.\"</li> <li>\"Also learned visual C# in university, toyed around with Golang and Rust projects (mostly on Twitch), and basically whatever tickles my fancy.\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>What is your education level (or lack of)<ul> <li>\"I have a bachelor's degree in economics and political science, but I've also pursued additional education and certifications in IT and cybersecurity to further my career.\" </li> <li>\"I have formal university education in Information Technology and Systems. Additionally, I am considering going back to graduate school, a long-time goal of mine, to further enhance my knowledge and skills in the HPC field (which values academia/traditional education more than other areas of tech).\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>What have you taught yourself?<ul> <li>\"I've taught myself various skills that have been instrumental in my career journey, including blue/red teaming cybersecurity concepts, scripting/programming  languages, the foundations of [[Linux]] and networking through self-study and hands- on experience (with a good portion streamed live on Twitch). \"While working as a sourcer/recruiter, I was sourcing for a [[Linux]] Kernel Development position. This experience exposed me to the fascinating world of [[Linux]] and kernel development, sparking a deep interest in the field. Additionally, my earlier hobbyism in GPG/PGP cryptography, which I pursued without realizing its significance at the time, led me to explore encryption methods and [[Linux]] systems. It was only in hindsight that I realized these experiences were early indicators of my interest in technology. These  experiences have taught me the value of continuous learning and self-improvement in the ever-evolving field of technology.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>How important are certs?<ul> <li>\"Researching certifications has been crucial in my career development. While I do no actually have any IT certifications, I sure have studied for my fair share! I believe, from my research/experience, that obtaining certifications depends on one's role and the existing job market. It's important to do your due diligence to verify that the certification will test the skills relevant to your job and must discern whether the vendor is reputable. </li> <li>\"Also, you need to make personal decisions regarding your finances that, in my experience, no one can actually make for you. Again, do an effective analysis of the other aspects I mentioned (vendor, etc.). Unfortunately, I have known too many people who have been sold a bill of goods on certifications and things like bootcamps that never actually pay off. So please be careful out there! </li> <li>\"In HPC/[[Linux]], formal education is valued over certifications. However, when I was working in desktop support, certifications like A+ and Network+ would've been ideal for advancement in that area.</li> <li>\"Trusted vendor, affordable so would've been worthwhile.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>How you did you land your job in cyber security to get in the industry?<ul> <li>\"I landed my job in HPC/[[Linux]] through a combination of unique opportunities,     networking, and my educational background. I saw an internal opening at my     organization for the role and thought it would be a great fit for me. I consulted with my mentor, a former professor, and a high-ranking member of the organization I worked for, who encouraged me to pursue it. Despite having a subpar interview, I was hired, partly due to my past work with the organization as a desktop support worker, the great references I received from getting to know co-workers who were also promoted, and my Twitch streams/content that showed I had ability greater than what I could articulate while nervous in the interview. My second stint in university, where I took a course in [[Linux]] Administration, also played a significant role in preparing me for this     career path.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>How necessary is Building Relationships/Networking? LinkedIn, Discord, in person? <ul> <li>\"Building relationships and networking have been crucial in my career progression. Platforms like LinkedIn and Discord have helped me connect with like-minded    professionals and expand my professional network. In fact, I would not have my current positions without networking. The majority of positions are filled internally and will never be posted to a site such as LinkedIn. </li> <li>\"The main thing about networking is you need to evaluate your strengths and determine where you excel. For example, if you are a great writer and work in web development, perhaps it would be best to develop your own site with a blog section. Or you can write blog entries on Medium or Substack that showcase your knowledge and ability. If you are excellent with project-based work and development, then build a portfolio and GitHub. LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., are simply vehicles to share this work. </li> <li>\"Personally, learning live on Twitch works well for me and, in conjunction with Strong in-person networking, led to my current path.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>The importance of stepping out of your comfort zone?<ul> <li>\"Stepping outside of your comfort zone is crucial for personal and professional growth. There are entire areas of psychology dedicated to helping individuals leave their comfort zones and enter their growth zones. In an ever-changing sector like technology, it's especially important to be constantly learning and adapting.</li> <li>\"In addition to being invested in constant learning, whether through formal education, certifications, or self-study, it's important to develop the skills to handle stepping outside your comfort zone.</li> <li>\"This involves evaluating your strengths, avoiding giving in to self-doubt or imposter syndrome, and keeping an open mind about areas where you can improve and how you can move forward. Embracing discomfort can lead to new opportunities and growth that may not have been possible otherwise.</li> <li>\"By the way, doing this interview is outside of my current zone.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>What are your employers expectations in your current role?<ul> <li>\"Effectively manage and maintain HPC systems, collaborate with researchers and teammates, and stay updated on emerging technologies in the field.\" </li> <li>\"It is a niche area and close-knit environment, so reinforcing those bonds is particularly  Important but I think that very much carries to other sectors of tech.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>What is advice that you wish  you knew when you started on your path in [[Linux]]/HPC?<ul> <li>\"Looking back, I wish I knew earlier in my career the value of networking, continuous learning, and the diverse paths available in technology careers. My early interest I working with GPG/PGP during university, for example, opened my eyes to the world of cryptography and [[Linux]] but it would take me years to realize this was indicative of a deeper interest in technology. These insights have been invaluable as I've navigated my journey in HPC/[[Linux]] administration.\"</li> <li>\"I also wish I had not written off STEM earlier in my life and would encourage people to be more open-minded about their abilities. The recent [[Linux]] workshop reinforce this, as there were as many paths to HPC/[[Linux]] as there were people at the conference.\"</li> <li>\"Additionally, I wish I knew earlier that it was okay to fail and to try again. Very few people can immediately grasp a concept and replicate those steps in a work  environment. with the right mindset, you can learn from failure and be stronger for it.</li> <li>\"Finally, it's important to know your worth as a worker.

With 2FA you'll need a second factor (something you know (like your mothers maiden name), something you have (like a token) or are (like your fingerprint)) </p> <p>For this tip we are focusing on phone based tokens that are sent to you via text message and app based tokens that expire after use or constantly change. </p> <p>Many of the accounts that you may have such as Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Snapchat already have 2 factor authentication available to use. If an account has it, enable it.</p> <p>Once activated they will ask you preference or require you to supply both, phone number and email. </p> <p>Then, if you log in from an unrecognized device or if someone else does, like say a hacker, you or they will be prompted for your second factor, such as a token sent to your phone, email or from your authenticator app. </p> <p>If you are not using an unrecognized device and you receive a notification like this, then it is safe to say that someone is trying to access your account.

These timeless pieces of advice, drawn from McRaven's experiences, serve as a guiding light for anyone striving to make a positive impact and change the world for the better. Here's a summary of his speech, highlighting the 10 pieces of advice he shared:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start with Making Your Bed: McRaven emphasized the importance of starting the day with a simple task completed, like making your bed. This sets the tone for accomplishing more tasks throughout the day, no matter how small they may seem. Start each day with a task completed</p> </li> <li> <p>Find Someone to Help You Paddle: Just as in SEAL training, where teamwork is essential, McRaven encouraged the graduates to seek help and collaborate with others in their journey through life. Find someone to help you get through life</p> </li> <li> <p>Measure a Person by the Size of Their Heart: Using the example of the \"munchkin\" boat crew, he emphasized that true success is not determined by physical attributes or background, but by the strength of character and determination. Respect Everyone</p> </li> <li> <p>Get Over Being a Sugar Cookie: Facing setbacks and failures is inevitable, but it's essential to persevere and keep moving forward, even when things don't go as planned. Know that life is not fair and you will fail often</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't Be Afraid of the Circuses: Challenges and failures are part of life, but they also build resilience and strength. Embracing these difficulties rather than avoiding them is crucial for growth. Don't be afraid of failure, learn from it</p> </li> <li> <p>Sometimes You Have to Slide Down the Obstacles Head First: Taking calculated risks and approaching obstacles with unconventional methods can lead to unexpected success, as demonstrated by the student who broke the obstacle course record. *Take Risks, *</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't Back Down from the Sharks: Confronting fears and challenges head-on is necessary for achieving goals. McRaven used the metaphor of sharks to represent the obstacles one might encounter in life. Face down the bullies</p> </li> <li> <p>Be Your Very Best in the Darkest Moments: During the most challenging times, it's essential to remain calm, composed, and resilient. These moments define one's character and ability to overcome adversity. Step up when times are the toughest</p> </li> <li> <p>Start Singing When You're Up to Your Neck in Mud: Maintaining hope and positivity, even in the toughest situations, can inspire others and lead to eventual success. Lift up the downtrodden</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't Ever, Ever Ring the Bell: Lastly, McRaven urged the graduates never to give up, no matter how difficult the journey may become. Success comes to those who persevere and refuse to quit. Never, ever give up</p> </li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"Stream/Topics/","title":"Topics","text":"<p>Malware/virus infections on stream. different phishing attempts</p> <p>Bash scripting | Ubuntu server | Podcast Prep | [[PNPT]] cert prep | text to speech !tts | !Coworking | !discord | !podcast | !amazon</p> <p>tags English CoLearning CoWorking BreaksStuff [[Linux]] BackseatingAllowed </p> <p>Subdomain Enumeration</p> <p>Network+ Hak5 tools O.MG cable Rubber Ducky Bash Bunny C2 Cloud Raspberry Pi  </p> <p>Titles THM KOTH day | Network+ study | breaking raspberry pi | Podcast Prep | SKIDS | CTF | Hak5 Pentesting Tools | !discord [[TryHackMe]] Tutorials | Hacking into Best Buy with Bluetooth earbuds for early Black Friday shopping | !discord [[TryHackMe]] Solar, exploiting log4j | !CTF | Hacking into the NFL with a Microsoft Surface Tablet | !discord  </p> <p>Go live notifications hacking the CLI with a GUI...

Twitch views the following as viewer. - A muted video player on Twitch, or the browser tab, with live video is playing. - Stream open playing live video in another tab, even if that tab is not in focus. - On Mobile, If live audio is playing or if you have minimized the live stream in the background on mobile.</p> <p>So, if you see me go live, Come and hang out. If you are busy and don't have time to watch simply pop open a tab and mute me. Don't feel the need to tell me you are lurking if you are busy.

The SUID bit allows the file to run with the privilege level of the account that owns it, rather than the account which runs it. This allows for an interesting privilege escalation path.  Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user.  <pre><code>find / -perm -u=s -type f 2&gt;/dev/null \n</code></pre></p> <p>What vulnerability seems to affect the kernal of the target system (3.13.0) Ubuntu? <pre><code>searchsploit 3.13\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------\n Exploit Title                                                                          |  Path\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------\nAjentiCP 1.2.23.13 - Cross-Site Scripting                                               | php/webapps/45691.txt\nApple Mac OSX xnu 1228.3.13 - 'macfsstat' Local Kernel Memory Leak/Denial of Service    | osx/dos/8263.c\nApple Mac OSX xnu 1228.3.13 - 'Profil' Kernel Memory Leak/Denial of Service (PoC)       | osx/dos/8264.c\nApple Mac OSX xnu 1228.3.13 - 'zip-notify' Remote Kernel Overflow (PoC)                 | osx/dos/8262.c\nApple Mac OSX xnu 1228.3.13 - IPv6-ipcomp Remote kernel Denial of Service (PoC)         | multiple/dos/5191.c\nAtlassian JIRA 3.13.5 - File Download Security Bypass                                   | multiple/remote/35898.php\nBludit 3.13.1 - 'username' Cross Site Scripting (XSS)                                   | php/webapps/50529.txt\nChevereto 3.13.4 Core - Remote Code Execution                                           | php/webapps/47903.py\nDeluge Web UI 1.3.13 - Cross-Site Request Forgery                                       | json/webapps/41541.html\nGetSimple CMS 3.3.13 - Cross-Site Scripting                                             | php/webapps/44408.txt\nid Software Solaris Quake II 3.13/3.14 / QuakeWorld 2.0/2.1 / Quake 1.9/3.13/3.14 - Com | linux/remote/19079.c\nLinux Kernel 3.13 - SGID Privilege Escalation                                           | linux/local/33824.c\nLinux Kernel 3.13.0 &lt; 3.19 (Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/14.10/15.04) - 'overlayfs' Local Privile | linux/local/37292.c\n\nsearchsploit -x 37292\n/*\n# Exploit Title: ofs.c - overlayfs local root in ubuntu\n# Date: 2015-06-15\n# Exploit Author: rebel\n# Version: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10, 15.04 (Kernels before 2015-06-15)\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10, 15.04\n# CVE : CVE-2015-1328     (http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Automated Enumeration Tools * [[LinPeas]]: [[https]]://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/[[linPEAS]] * LinEnum: [[https]]://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum * LES ([[Linux]] Exploit Suggester): [[https]]://github.com/mzet-/[[linux]]-exploit-suggester * [[Linux]] Smart Enumeration: [[https]]://github.com/diego-treitos/[[linux]]-smart-enumeration * [[Linux]] Priv Checker: [[https]]://github.com/linted/linuxprivchecker *</p>"},{"location":"Tryhackme/OpenVPN/","title":"OpenVPN","text":"<p>Required for KOTH </p> <pre><code>sudo openvpn /home/kali/Downloads/7h30.ovpn\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Tryhackme/Overpass/","title":"Overpass","text":"<p>/about us Ninja Pars Szymex Bee MuirlandOracle</p>"},{"location":"Tryhackme/Principles%20of%20Security/","title":"Principles of Security","text":"<p>The CIA Triad Confidentiatlity, Integrity, Availability  </p> <p>Confidentiality - the protection of data for unauthorized access and misuse examples - employee records, accounting documents  </p> <p>Integrity - the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.
